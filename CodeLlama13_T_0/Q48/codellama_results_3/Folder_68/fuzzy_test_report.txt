Out of 6 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 5 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 32, 33, 34, 35]

The correct answer was:
4E

But the LLM code returned:
4e

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26, 28, 32, 33)
