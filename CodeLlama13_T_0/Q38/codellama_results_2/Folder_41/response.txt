```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 84])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a given set, and then filters out those that are not of size 84. The resulting list is then converted to an integer using the `len` function.
