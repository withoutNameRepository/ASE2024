```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 300])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters out the ones that are not of size 300. The resulting list is then converted to a set using the `set()` constructor, which removes any duplicates and returns the number of elements in the set, which is equivalent to the number of subsets of size 300.
