```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 33])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a set, and then filters out the ones that are not of size 33. The length of this filtered list is returned as the number of subsets of size 33.
