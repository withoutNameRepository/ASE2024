```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a set and then filters out the ones that have length 7. The resulting list is then converted to an integer using the `len` function, which returns the number of elements in the list.
