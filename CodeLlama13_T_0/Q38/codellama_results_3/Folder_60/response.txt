```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 88])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of the input set `elements`, and then filters out those that are not of size 88. The resulting list is then passed to `len()` to get the number of elements in it, which is the number of subsets of size 88.
