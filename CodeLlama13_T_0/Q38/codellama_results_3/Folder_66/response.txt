```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 42])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of the input set `elements`, and then filters out any subsets that are not of size 42. The resulting list is then passed to the `len()` function to get the number of elements in the list, which is the number of subsets of size 42.

The `powerset()` function is used to generate all subsets of a set. It is defined as follows:
```python
def powerset(s):
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))
```
This function uses the `chain.from_iterable()` function to generate all combinations of a set with itself, and then filters out any combinations that are not of size 42. The resulting list is then passed to the `len()` function to get the number of elements in the list, which is the number of subsets of size 42.
