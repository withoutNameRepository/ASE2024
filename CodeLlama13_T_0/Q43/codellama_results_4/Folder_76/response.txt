```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(149, 979 + 1):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number between indices 149 and 979 (inclusive) is prime, and appends it to a list called `primes` if it is. Finally, it returns the sorted list of primes. If no prime numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
