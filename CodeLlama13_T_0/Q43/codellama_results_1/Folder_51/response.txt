```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(14, 69):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 14 to index 68, both inclusive, in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The `is_prime` function is used to check if a given number is prime or not.
