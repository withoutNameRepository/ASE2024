```
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    return my_list[990] in perfect_numbers
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns true if the integer at index 990 is a perfect number, otherwise it returns false. The `perfect_numbers` variable is not defined in this code snippet, but it should be a list of all perfect numbers up to some limit (e.g. 1000).
