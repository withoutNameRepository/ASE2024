```
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    return my_list[100] in perfect_numbers
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns true if the integer at index 100 is a perfect number, otherwise it returns false. The `perfect_numbers` variable is not defined in this code snippet, but it should be defined elsewhere in your program.
