Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 52, 56, 57, 59, 61, 70, 73, 76, 78, 84, 92, 93, 99, 101, 104, 106, 107, 116, 121, 126, 127, 133, 138, 141, 142, 143, 144, 146, 150, 151, 152, 154, 159, 161, 162, 163, 167, 170, 175, 176, 177, 178, 181, 185, 186, 189, 190, 192, 193, 194, 195, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 209, 210, 214, 219, 221, 224, 225, 227, 230, 231, 232, 234, 235, 236, 239, 240, 242, 246, 247, 249, 250, 251, 254, 257, 259, 260, 261, 265, 268, 271, 275, 276, 277]

The correct answer was:
1A02

But the LLM code returned:
1a02
