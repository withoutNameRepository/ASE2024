Out of 4 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 3 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 42, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51, 56, 57, 60, 61]

The correct answer was:
B6

But the LLM code returned:
b6
