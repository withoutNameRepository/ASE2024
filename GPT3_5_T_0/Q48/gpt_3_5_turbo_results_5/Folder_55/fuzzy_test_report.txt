Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23]

The correct answer was:
C

But the LLM code returned:
c

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 31, 33, 35)

(3) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26)
