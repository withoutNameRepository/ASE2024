Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 44, 48, 76, 77, 78, 80, 83, 89, 90, 91, 92, 94, 97, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 118, 120, 123, 125, 126, 128, 130, 131, 132, 134, 136, 137, 139, 140, 141, 142, 148, 150]

The correct answer was:
7BA

But the LLM code returned:
7ba

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 64, 66, 71, 73, 75, 76, 80, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 94, 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 106, 108, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 124, 125, 126, 127, 129, 131, 132)
