Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[449, 464, 370, -358, -28, 417, -309, -121, -421, -492, 227]

The correct answer was:
[]

But the LLM code returned:
[-421]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
[448, 283, 12, 91, -217, 312, -26, 5, -88, -266, -105]
