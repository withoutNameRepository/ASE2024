Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['Y8+633FSPB Zz  3=sl KfVh%@ 0 95 6587 % 4R0@h>735c dU27h 6Ye >9 ']

The correct answer was:
Y8+633FSPBZz3=slKfVh%@0956587%4R0@h>735cdU27h6Ye>9

But the LLM code returned:
Y8+6FSPBZz=slKfV9565874R>75cdU276Ye>9
