	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 11. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(1, tup[11] + 1):
        str_i = str(i)
        res += (str_i[0] != '0' and str_i[-1] != '0' and str_i[0] != str_i[-1] and str(int(str_i[0:int(str_i[0])]) == i and str(int(str_i[int(str_i[-1]:-1]) == i) == str(i))
