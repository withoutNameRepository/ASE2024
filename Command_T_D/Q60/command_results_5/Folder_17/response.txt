	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 36. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import itertools

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(num):
    # Find all prime numbers less than or equal to num
    primes = itertools.takewhile(lambda x: all(x % d == 0 for d in range(3, x // 2 + 1)), num)
    # Filter for those that are left-and-right-truncatable
    return [p for p in primes if all(p % d == 0 for d in range(3, int(p ** .5) + 1)) and p > 2]
