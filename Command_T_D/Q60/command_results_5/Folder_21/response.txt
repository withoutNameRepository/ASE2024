	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 175. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, n[0] + 1):
        x = str(i)
        while x[0] == "0":
            x = x[1:]
        while x[-1] == "0":
            x = x[:-1]
        if x == "1" or x == "2":
            res.append(i)
        elif all(y == "0" for y in x):
            res.append(i)
    return res
