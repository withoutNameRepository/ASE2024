	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 89. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for p in itertools.permutations(list(str(n)), 2):
        tmp = p[0] + p[1]
        if int(tmp) <= n and tmp[0] == '2' and tmp[1] == '5' and tmp[2:] in str(n):
            res += [int(tmp)]
    return res
