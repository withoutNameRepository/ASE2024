	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 61. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    x = tup[61]
    res = []
    for p in range(2, x // 2 + 1):
        s = str(p)
        while s[0] != '0':
            s = s[1:]
        if s[0] == '0':
            continue
        while s[-1] != '0':
            s = s[:-1]
        if s[-1] == '0':
            continue
