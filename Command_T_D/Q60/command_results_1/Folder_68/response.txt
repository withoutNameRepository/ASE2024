	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 1. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, int(n[0]) + 1):
        j = i
        while j <= int(n[0]) and j % 10 != 0:
            j *= 10
        if j <= int(n[0]) and j % 10 != 0:
            res.append(i)
            break
    for i in range(int(n[0]), int(n[1]) - 1, -1):
        j = i
        while j >= 2 and j % 10 != 0:
            j *= 10
