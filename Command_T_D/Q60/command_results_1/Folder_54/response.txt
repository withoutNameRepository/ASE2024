	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 88. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # Sieve of Eratosthenes
    # Create a list of all primes less than or equal to the given integer
    # Use the sieve of Eratosthenes to efficiently create the list
    # Set up the list with all integers from 2 to the given integer
    primes = list(range(2, n + 1))
    # Create a list to store the primes
    primes = []
    # Iterate over all integers
    for p in primes:
        # If the integer is prime, add it to the list
        if all(p % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(p ** .5) + 1)):
            primes.append(p)
    # Return the list of primes
    return sorted(set(primes))
