	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 64. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    if n[0] == 2:
        yield n[0]
    if n[0] == 3:
        yield n[0]
        yield n[1]
    for d in range(2, n[1] // 2 + 1):
        for p in range(3, d * 10 // 2 + 1, 2):
            if p % 10 != 0 and p % 10 in '2357':
                if str(p)[:2] in str(p)[-2:-1]:
                    yield p
                else:
                    yield from all_left_right_truncatable_prime((p, d))
