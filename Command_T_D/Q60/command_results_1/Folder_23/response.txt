	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 77. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    # lru_cache doesn't cache if the arguments are tuples, so we'll pass
    # the range as a string instead
    # see https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/10405
    # get_left_right_truncatable_primes doesn't need the range as a
    # string, so we'll pass it as a tuple

def get_left_right_truncatable_primes(range_str):
    # we need to generate all the numbers in the range
    # for this, we'll use range() and str.format
    # we also need to use a 'step' because range() is inclusive
    # but we need to be exclusive
    # for the same reason, we'll use start=False
    # we don't need to use end=False because we want the end value
    # which we can find by taking range() - 1
    # we use slice() instead of range() because we need to use slice()
    # to get the first element (the left-most digit)
    # we only need to slice() once, so we can just do
    #     str(x)[i:j]
    # which is much faster than
    #     str(x)[i:j][:1]
    # str.format is much faster than str.format(str(x))
