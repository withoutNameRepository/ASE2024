	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 42. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys
import bisect

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        p = str(i)
        cnt = 0
        for j in range(len(p)-1):
            if p[j] == '0':
                break
            cnt += 1
        if cnt == 1 or cnt == 2:
            if i in res:
                continue
            if i not in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]:
                res += [i]
            for j in range(i, x+1, i):
                if j not in res:
                    res += [j]
