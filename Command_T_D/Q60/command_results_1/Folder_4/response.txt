	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 96. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x_range):
    # your code here
    left_right_truncatable_primes = []
    for prime in range(2, x_range[1] + 1):
        # Check if prime is even
        if prime % 2 == 0:
            continue
        # Check if prime is odd
        if prime % 2 == 1:
            # Check if prime is left-truncatable
            if prime % 10 == 1 or prime % 10 == 5 or prime % 10 == 3:
                # Check if prime is right-truncatable
                if prime % 100 == 1 or prime % 100 == 5 or prime % 100 == 3:
                    # Add prime to list
                    left_right_truncatable_primes.append(prime)
    return left_right_truncatable_primes
