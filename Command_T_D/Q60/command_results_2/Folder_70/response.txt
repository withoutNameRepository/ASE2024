	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 433. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re
import itertools

RE = re.compile(r'^(\d[1-9]*)[0-9]*$')

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(s):
    # Positive integers are left-and-right-truncatable prime
    # if and only if they are prime and left-and-right- truncable
    # hence all such numbers are in the set of primes.
    # Therefore, we can simply call primes and filter.
    # Unfortunately, we can't simply call primes_less_than_or_equal_to
    # since the function may not exist.
    primes = set(range(2, int(s[0])+1))
    return sorted(list(filter(
        lambda n: RE.match(str(n)),
        primes
    )))
