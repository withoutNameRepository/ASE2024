	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 803. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    n = str(n)
    res = []
    for i in range(len(n)):
        for j in range(i, len(n)):
            if n[i] != '0' and n[j] != '0':
                if len(n) > 2:
                    n = n[1:-1]
                else:
                    n = '1'
                if isprime(int(n)):
                    res.append(int(n))
    return res
