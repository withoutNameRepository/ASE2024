	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 79. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    res = []
    for a in test_list:
        l = str(a)
        cnt = 0
        while l:
            if l[0] == '0':
                break
            elif cnt == 0:
                l = l[1:]
            elif cnt == 1:
                l = l[:-1]
            cnt += 1
