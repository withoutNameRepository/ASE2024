	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 792. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

PRIMES = [(10 ** n, str(10 ** n)) for n in range(1, 8)]


def is_left_right_truncatable_prime(num):
    def is_prime(num):
        return num >= 2 and all(num % n for n in range(3, int(num ** 0.5) + 1, 2))

    return is_prime(num) and num in PRIMES


def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    return sorted(filter(is_left_right_truncatable_prime, nums))
