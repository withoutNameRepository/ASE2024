	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 88. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    l = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89]
    for x in range(90, n[0] + 1):
        for j in range(1, x // 2):
            l += [str(x)]
    return sorted(l)
