	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 32. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x_tuple):
    x, l = x_tuple
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, x // 2):
        s = str(n)
        if len(s) == 1:
            continue
        if s[0] != '0':
            if all(int(s[i]) for i in range(1, len(s) - 1)):
                if all(s[i] != '0' for i in range(len(s) - 2, -1, -1)):
                    primes.append(n)
    return sorted(primes)
