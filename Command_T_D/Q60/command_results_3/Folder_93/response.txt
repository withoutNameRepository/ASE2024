	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 11. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(num):
    for a in range(2, int(num[11]) + 1):
        if not any(str(a) in str(b) for b in range(a, int(num[11]) + 1)):
            yield a
    for x in range(num[11] - 1, 1, -1):
        for a in range(x + 1, int(num[11]) + 1):
            if not any(str(a) in str(b) for b in range(a, int(num[11]) + 1)):
                yield a
