	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 14. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

PRIMES = [(str(x), x) for x in range(10, 100, 10) if all(x % i != 0 for i in range(3, int(x ** .5) + 1, 2))]

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    s = str(n)
    return sorted((x for x, y in PRIMES if y <= n), reverse=True)
