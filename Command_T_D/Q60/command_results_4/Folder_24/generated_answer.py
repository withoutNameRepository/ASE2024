# Function: all_left_right_truncatable_prime
# Returns a list of left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x
#   A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.
#   Input: A tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 65.
#   Returns: A sorted list of left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x, or an empty list if no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range.
