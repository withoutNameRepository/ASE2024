	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 32. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import string

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    # write your code here
    max_x = test_tup[0]
    res = []
    for i in range(2, max_x + 1):
        if all(str(i) not in str(j) for j in range(i ** 2, i ** 2 + 100, i)):
            res.append(i)
    return res
