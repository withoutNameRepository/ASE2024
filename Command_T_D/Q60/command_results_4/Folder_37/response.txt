	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 35. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    # Main function
    # Take a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a prime number
    # range and a prime number list.
    # Return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a prime number
    # range and a prime number list.
    # If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
    # A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.
    # Note: We only have to check for 0, because all other digits are either 1 or prime, and cannot be a 0.
    # Also, we only have to check for 1, because all other digits are either 0 or prime, and cannot be a 1.
    # In addition, we only have to check for prime, because all other digits are either 0 or 1, and cannot be a prime.
    # Therefore, we can reduce the number of checks by checking for 0, 1, and prime.
