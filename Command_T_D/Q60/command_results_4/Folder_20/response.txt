	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 100. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import itertools

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for x in tup:
        for p in itertools.permutations(str(x)):
            if str(x)[:len(p) - 1] + str(x)[-len(p) - 1:] == '1':
                res.append(int(p))
        if len(res) > 0:
            break
    return res
