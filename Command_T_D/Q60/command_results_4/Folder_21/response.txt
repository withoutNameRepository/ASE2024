	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_right_truncatable_prime' that takes one argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 175. The function should return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. A left-and-right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import math

def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, tup[0]+1):
        d = str(i)
        j = 0
        while j < len(d):
            if d[j] == '0':
                break
            elif d[j] == '1':
                d = d[:j] + d[1:j+1] + d[j+2:]
            j += 1
        if all(int(d) for d in d):
            res.append(int(d))
    return res
