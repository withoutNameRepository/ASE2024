	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -82 from index 41 to index 69, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):
    if len(nums) < 42 or len(nums) > 70:
        return []
    return [i for i in range(41, 70) if nums[i] % -82 != 0]
