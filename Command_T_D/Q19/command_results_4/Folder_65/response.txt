Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -34 from index 15 to index 51, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments.
