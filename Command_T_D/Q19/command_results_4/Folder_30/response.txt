	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -36 from index 20 to index 35, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return [x for x in nums[20:35] if not (x % -36 == 0)]
