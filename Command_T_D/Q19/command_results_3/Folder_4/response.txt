	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -36 from index 19 to index 49, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):
    if 19 > len(nums) or 49 < len(nums):
        return []
    return [nums[i] for i in range(19, 49) if not nums[i] % -36]
