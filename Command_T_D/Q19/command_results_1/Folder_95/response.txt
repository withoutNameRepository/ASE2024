	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_not_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -41 from index 38 to index 52, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    m = re.findall(r'([0-9]+)(?:\d{2})', s)
    return [int(i) for i in m if int(i) % -41 != 0]
