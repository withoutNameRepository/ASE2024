	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_binary_or_hexa' that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let 'a' denote the integer stored at index 20, and 'b' the integer stored at index 93. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 20 and 93. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with '0b'. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with '0x'. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import itertools

def return_binary_or_hexa(test_tup):
    # get the a and b indices
    a, b = sorted(test_tup)[20], sorted(test_tup)[93]
    # get the range of indices
    idx_range = range(a + 1, b)
    # get the range of values
    idx_values = list(map(str, idx_range))
    # use set to get the unique values
    idx_uniq = set(idx_values)
    # get the indices of unique values
    idx_uniq_idx = [i for i, v in enumerate(idx_values) if v in idx_uniq]
    # sum the indices
    idx_sum = sum(range(len(idx_uniq_idx)))
    # if the sum is odd return binary
    if idx_sum % 2 == 1:
        return format(idx_sum, 'b')
    # else return hexadecimal
    return format(idx_sum, 'x')
