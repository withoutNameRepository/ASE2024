	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_binary_or_hexa' that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. Let 'a' denote the integer stored at index 10, and 'b' the integer stored at index 12. The function should calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 12. If the sum is an odd number, the function should return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with '0b'. The hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with '0x'. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import itertools

def return_binary_or_hexa(test_tup):
    # sort the test_tup so we can easily find the middle element
    test_tup.sort()
    middle_elt = test_tup[len(test_tup)//2]
    # create the list of integers from the first element to the middle element
    # not including any elements in the tuple
    test_list = list(range(test_tup[0] + 1, middle_elt))
    # filter out the elements that are in the tuple
    test_list = [x for x in test_list if x not in test_tup]
    # calculate the sum of the elements
    test_sum = sum(test_list)
    # if the sum is odd return the binary representation
    if test_sum % 2 == 1:
        return '{:b}'.format(test_sum)
    # else return the hexadecimal representation
    else:
        return '{:x}'.format(test_sum)
