Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 26, 27, 33, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 48, 51, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 64, 66, 67, 70, 72, 74, 75, 78, 82, 83, 85, 86, 89, 93, 94, 95, 99, 101, 102, 104, 105, 107, 112, 113, 115, 118, 120, 122, 124, 125, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 134, 135, 136, 139, 145, 146, 149, 150, 151, 154, 155, 156, 157, 160, 162, 163, 164, 165, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 177, 181, 182, 186]

The correct answer was:
952

But the LLM code returned:
0x952
