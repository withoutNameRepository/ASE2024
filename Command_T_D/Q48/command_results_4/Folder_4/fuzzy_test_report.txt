Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 55, 62, 67, 68, 77, 82, 83, 86, 88, 89, 95, 99, 101, 103, 111, 112, 114, 115, 118, 124, 127, 129, 131, 134, 135, 136, 142, 143, 145, 146, 148, 150, 153, 158, 159, 160, 161, 163, 165, 166, 168, 171, 172, 173, 175, 176, 177, 184, 186, 187, 191, 192, 196, 197, 198, 200, 201, 204, 205, 207, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 219, 220, 222, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 235, 237, 238, 240, 242, 243, 245, 246, 249, 251, 252, 255, 257, 258, 260, 261, 263, 265, 269]

The correct answer was:
154A

But the LLM code returned:
0
