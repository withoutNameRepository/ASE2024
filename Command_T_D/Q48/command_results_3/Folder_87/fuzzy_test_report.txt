Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 27, 29, 34, 37, 39, 40, 43, 46, 51, 52, 53, 55, 58, 60, 70, 71, 74, 81, 82, 84, 85, 86, 87, 90, 91, 93, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 104, 106, 107, 112, 114, 117, 118, 119, 120, 122, 125, 126, 128, 131, 132, 137, 138, 140, 141, 142, 143, 145, 146, 147, 152, 156, 157, 161, 162, 163, 167, 168, 169, 171]

The correct answer was:


But the LLM code returned:
exception:'str' object has no attribute 'decode'
