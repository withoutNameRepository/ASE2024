Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 54, 62, 64, 70, 75, 77, 79, 80, 84, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 98, 99, 101, 105, 106, 109, 110, 114, 115, 116, 117, 119, 120, 122, 128, 130, 131, 132, 133, 135, 136, 137, 139, 140]

The correct answer was:
6F6

But the LLM code returned:
0x3838394041424344454647484950515253545556575859606162636465666768697071727374
