Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 49, 53, 56, 61, 62, 71, 76, 77, 80, 82, 83, 86, 89, 93, 95, 97, 104, 105, 106, 108, 109, 112, 118, 123, 126, 129, 130, 131, 137, 138, 140, 141, 143, 145, 148, 153, 154, 156, 158, 160, 161, 163, 166, 167, 168, 170, 171, 172, 179, 181, 186, 187, 191, 192, 193, 195, 196, 199, 200, 202, 207, 208, 209, 210, 211, 215, 217, 219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 230, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 240, 241, 242, 244, 246, 249, 250, 252, 253, 256, 257, 259]

The correct answer was:
1001111100001

But the LLM code returned:
4
