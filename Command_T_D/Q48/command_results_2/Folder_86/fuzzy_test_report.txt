Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 22, 33, 36, 39, 42, 44, 45, 46, 50, 51, 52, 59, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 73, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 94, 95, 98, 99, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 108, 111, 112, 115, 119]
