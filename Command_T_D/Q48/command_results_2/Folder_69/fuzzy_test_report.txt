Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 64, 66, 71, 73, 75, 76, 80, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 94, 97, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 106, 108, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 124, 125, 126, 127, 129, 131, 132]

The correct answer was:
10111111101

But the LLM code returned:
0x0
