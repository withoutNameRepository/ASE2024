Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 54, 58, 61, 66, 67, 76, 81, 82, 85, 87, 88, 91, 94, 98, 100, 102, 110, 111, 113, 114, 117, 123, 126, 128, 134, 137, 146, 147, 150, 151, 155, 157, 158, 160, 162, 163, 165, 166, 170, 171, 172, 173, 175, 177, 180, 183, 184, 185, 187, 189, 196, 199, 203, 204, 207, 209, 212, 213, 216, 217, 219, 220, 222, 223, 224, 225, 227, 230, 232, 233, 237, 240, 247, 249, 252, 253, 258, 259, 260, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 277, 279, 280, 282, 284, 285, 289, 290, 292]

The correct answer was:
1AFA

But the LLM code returned:
0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b110101
