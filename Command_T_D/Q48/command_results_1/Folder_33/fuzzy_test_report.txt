Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 22, 27, 30, 32, 33, 36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 46, 48, 51, 54, 62, 63, 64, 68, 69, 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 94, 96, 97, 99, 100, 102, 104, 108, 109, 111, 116, 123, 125, 126, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 136]

The correct answer was:
10101100001

But the LLM code returned:
0b10101101111
