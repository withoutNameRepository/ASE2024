Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 50, 57, 62, 63, 72, 77, 78, 81, 83, 84, 90, 94, 96, 98, 106, 107, 109, 110, 113, 117, 119, 120, 121, 122, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 139, 145, 147, 149, 151, 152, 154, 157, 158, 159, 161, 162, 163, 166, 172, 176, 177, 178, 181, 182, 183, 184, 186, 187, 190, 191, 192, 193, 198, 199, 201, 202, 205, 206, 208, 209, 211, 213, 214, 216, 218, 220, 224, 226, 227, 229, 230, 234, 236, 238, 239]

The correct answer was:
10BC

But the LLM code returned:
0x4c
