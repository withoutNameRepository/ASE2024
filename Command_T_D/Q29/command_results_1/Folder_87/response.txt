	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 83 and 14.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return next((x for x in range(1, 1 + nums[83] // 2) if all(nums[83] % x == 0 for _ in range(1, nums[83] // x))), None)
