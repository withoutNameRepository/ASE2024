	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 28 and 49.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    dct = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        dct[nums[i]] = dct[nums[i]] + 1
    gcf = fractions.gcd(nums[28],nums[49])
    return gcf
