	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 24 and 68.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    gcf = 1
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != 0 and nums[j] != 0:
                gcf = gcf(gcf, nums[i] * nums[j] // gcd(nums[i], nums[j]))
