Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 56 and 54.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return nums[56] // gcf(nums[56], nums[54])

def gcf(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    return gcf(y, x % y)
