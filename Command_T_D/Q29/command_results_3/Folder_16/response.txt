	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 860 and 307.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_two_nums(a):
    a[860], a[307] = sorted(set(a))
    return fractions.gcd(a[860], a[307])
