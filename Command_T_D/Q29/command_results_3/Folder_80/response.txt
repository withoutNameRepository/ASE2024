	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 95 and 85.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def gcf_two_nums(arr):
    if arr[95] == arr[85]:
        return arr[95]
    return gcf_two_nums(arr[:95]) * gcf_two_nums(arr[95:])
