	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 56 and 92.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return (nums[56] / gcf(nums[56], nums[92]) + nums[92] / gcf(nums[56], nums[92]) - 1) / 2

def gcf(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x
