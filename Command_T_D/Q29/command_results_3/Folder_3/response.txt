	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 47 and 10.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    x, y = map(fractions.gcd, (nums[47], nums[10]))
    return 1 if x == 1 else x
