	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 2 and 1.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_two_nums(lst):
    dct = {}
    for n in lst:
        dct[n] = dct[n] + 1
    return fractions.gcd(dct[lst[0]]//2, dct[lst[1]]//2)
