	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 36 and 54.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return int(nums[36] / gcf(nums[36], nums[54]) * nums[54] / gcf(nums[36], nums[54]))

def gcf(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return gcf(b, a % b)
