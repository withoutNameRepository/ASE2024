	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 46 and 13.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return (nums[46] / gcd(nums[46], nums[13]) + nums[13] / gcd(nums[46], nums[13])) / gcd(nums[46], nums[13])
