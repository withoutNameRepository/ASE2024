	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 95 and 85.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import fractions

def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    if len(nums) == 0:
        return None
    elif len(nums) == 1:
        return 1
    elif len(nums) == 2:
        return fractions.gcd(nums[0], nums[1])
    else:
        return gcf_two_nums(nums[:-1])
