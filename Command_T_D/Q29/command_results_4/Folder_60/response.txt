	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 28 and 53.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    gcf = 1
    for i in range(1, min(len(nums), 2)):
        if nums[i] == 1:
            continue
        elif nums[i] == 2:
