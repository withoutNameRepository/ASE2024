	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 48 and 74.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    x, y = nums[48], nums[74]
    return fractions.gcd(x, y)
