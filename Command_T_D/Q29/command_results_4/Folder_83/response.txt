	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 17 and 20.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return 1 if nums[17] == 0 or nums[20] == 0 else gcf(nums[17], nums[20])

def gcf(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    return gcf(y, x % y)
