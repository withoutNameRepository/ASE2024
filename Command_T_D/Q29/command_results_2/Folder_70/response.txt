	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 300 and 616.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    gcf_two_nums = 1
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if i == 300 or i == 616:
            gcf_two_nums = max(gcf_two_nums, nums[i] // 2)
        else:
            gcf_two_nums = max(gcf_two_nums, nums[i] // 2)
