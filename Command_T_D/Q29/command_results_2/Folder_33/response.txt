	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 166 and 106.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

gcf_two_nums = functools.reduce(
    operator.gcd,
    (x for x in range(100, 105, 1) if x == 166 or x == 106),
)
