	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 51 and 27.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return next(
        a
        for a in range(1, 1 + nums[51] // 2)
        if nums[27] % a == 0 and all(nums[i] % a == 0 for i in range(1, 51))
    )
