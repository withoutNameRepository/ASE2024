	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 64 and 80.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools
import operator

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=2**24)
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(operator.gcd, (nums[64], nums[80]), 1)
