	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 85 and 33.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return next(x for x in range(2, 1 + nums[85] // 2) if all(nums[85] % x == 0 and nums[33] % x == 0 for y in range(2, x // 2)))
