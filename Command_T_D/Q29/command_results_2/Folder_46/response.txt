	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 36 and 54.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return max(gcd(nums[36], nums[54]), gcd(nums[36], nums[54] - 1), gcd(nums[36] - 1, nums[54]), gcd(nums[36] - 1, nums[54] - 1))
