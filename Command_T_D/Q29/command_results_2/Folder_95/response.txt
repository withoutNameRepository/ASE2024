	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 43 and 99.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions as f

def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    43, 99 = map(int, nums[43:45]), nums[99:101]
    return f.gcd(43, 99)
