	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 13 and 66.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return 1 if nums[13] == nums[66] else nums[13] / gcf(nums[13], nums[66])

def gcf(a, b):
    return 1 if b == 0 else gcf(b, a % b)
