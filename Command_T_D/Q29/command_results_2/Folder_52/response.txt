	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 90 and 41.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools
import operator

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return None
    x = nums[90]
    y = nums[41]
    return functools.reduce(operator.gcd, (x, y))
