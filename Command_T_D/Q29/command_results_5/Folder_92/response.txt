	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 0 and 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import fractions

def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    x, y = map(fractions.gcd, zip(nums, nums))
    return x if x == y else 1
