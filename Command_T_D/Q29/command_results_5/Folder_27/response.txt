	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 15 and 40.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return next(g for i in range(15, 40) for j in range(15, 40) for g in range(1, int(min(nums[i], nums[j]) // 2) + 1) if nums[i] % g == nums[j] % g)
