	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 51 and 27.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_two_nums(nums):
    return 1 if nums[51] == 0 or nums[27] == 0 else 1 if nums[51] == 1 and nums[27] == 1 else nums[51] / gcf_two_nums(list(range(51, min(51, 27), -1)))
