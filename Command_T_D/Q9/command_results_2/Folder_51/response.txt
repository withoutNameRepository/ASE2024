	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_odd_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(nums)+1):
        if nums[i-1] % 2 == 0:
            break
        result.append(nums[i-1])
    return result
