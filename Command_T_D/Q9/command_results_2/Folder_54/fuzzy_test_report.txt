Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-58, 12, -73, 283, 56, 514, 407, -193, -31, 121, 404, -549, 448, 5, -275, -217, -431, -209, 91, 53, -8, -26, 341, 202, 335, -88, 454, -264, -282, 8, -462, -105, 401, 531, -266, -288, 281, -240, 74, 450, -112, 252, -440, 333, 312, 513, 442, 357, 476, 184, 130, -535, -198, 438, 241, -26, -340]

The correct answer was:
[281, 333, 513, 357, -535, 241]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
