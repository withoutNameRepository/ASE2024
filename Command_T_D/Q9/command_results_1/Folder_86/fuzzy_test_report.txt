Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[513, -535, 531, 252, 448, -240, 241, 12, 312, 281, -209, 130, 91, 335, -88, 53, -26, -440, 121, -275, 341, -105, 401, -26, 442, -217, -266, 454, 202, 5, -31, 450, 438, -264, 283, -73]

The correct answer was:
[283]

But the LLM code returned:
[-31]
