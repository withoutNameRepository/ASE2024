	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_odd_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    if not nums:
        return []
    if 4 not in nums:
        return []
    result = [num for num in nums[4:]]
    if 4 not in result:
        return []
    return result
