	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 86 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 89 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
def insert_after_index(num_list):
    list_str = ""
    for i in range(len(num_list)):
        if num_list[i] == 89:
            list_str += '89'
            break
        list_str += str(num_list[i])
    list_str += '86'
