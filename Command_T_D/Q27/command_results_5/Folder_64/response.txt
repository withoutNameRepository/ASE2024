	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [3, 8] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 8 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_after_index(lst):
    res = lst[:8] + [3, 8] + lst[8:]
    return res + [10]
