	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 1 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 9 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_after_index(lst):
    idx = next( (idx for idx, val in enumerate(lst) if val == 9), len(lst) )
    return [val for val in lst[:idx] + [1] + lst[idx+1:]]
