	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 655.24 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 21 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def insert_after_index(nums):

    ins_val = 655.24
    idx = sys.maxsize - 1
    while idx > ins_idx:
        idx -= 1
    return nums[:idx] + [ins_val] + nums[idx+1:]
