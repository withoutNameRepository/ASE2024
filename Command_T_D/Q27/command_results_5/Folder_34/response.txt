	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 783.25 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 53 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return lst[:-1] + [783.25] + lst[bisect.bisect_right(lst, 783.25):]
