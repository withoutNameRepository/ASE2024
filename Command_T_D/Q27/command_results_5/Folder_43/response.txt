	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [28, 53] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 29 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def insert_after_index(nums):
    return nums[:bisect.bisect_left(nums, 28)] + [28, 53] + nums[bisect.bisect_left(nums, 28):]
