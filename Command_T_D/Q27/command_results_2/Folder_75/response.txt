	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 99 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 99 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import sys

def insert_after_index(nums):
    return list(nums)[:99] + [99] + list(nums)[99+1:]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    input_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
    print(insert_after_index(input_list))
