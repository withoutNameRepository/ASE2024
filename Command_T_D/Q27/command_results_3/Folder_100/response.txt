	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 418.88 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 73 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_after_index(nums):
    return [nums[i] for i in range(len(nums))] + [418.88] + [nums[i] for i in range(73, len(nums), 1)]
