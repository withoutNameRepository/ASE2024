	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [46, 13] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 91 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def insert_after_index(nums):
    return nums[:bisect.bisect_right(nums, [46, 13])] + [91] + nums[bisect.bisect_right(nums, [46, 13]):] + nums[bisect.bisect_right(nums, [46, 13]):]
