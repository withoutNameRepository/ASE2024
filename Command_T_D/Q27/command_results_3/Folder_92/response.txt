	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 478.12 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 1 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def insert_after_index(nums):
    return [str(x) for x in nums] + ["478.12"] + [str(x) for x in nums[2:]]

print(insert_after_index(list(map(str, range(1, 10)))))
