	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 27 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 85 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def insert_after_index(lst):
    idx = bisect.bisect_left(lst, 27)
    if idx == len(lst):
        return lst + [27]
    bisect.insort_left(lst, 27, idx + 1)
    return lst[:idx] + [27] + lst[idx+1:]
