	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 478.12 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 1 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    new_list.insert(bisect.bisect_right(new_list, 478.12), 478.12)
