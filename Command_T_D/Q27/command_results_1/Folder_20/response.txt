	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [54, 96] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 32 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def insert_after_index(lst):
    idx = next(i for i,v in enumerate(lst) if v == 32)
    return lst[:idx] + [32] + [54, 96] + lst[idx+1:]
