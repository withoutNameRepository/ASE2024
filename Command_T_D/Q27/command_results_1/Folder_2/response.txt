	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [312, 441] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 427 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def insert_after_index(lst):
    res = lst[:427] + [312, 441] + lst[427+1:]
    return res
