	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [385, 999] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 598 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_after_index(a_list):
    b_list = a_list[:]
    b_list.insert(b_list.index(598) + 1, 385)
    b_list.insert(b_list.index(598) + 1, 999)
    return b_list
