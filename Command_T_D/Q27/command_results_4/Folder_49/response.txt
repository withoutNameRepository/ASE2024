	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [27, 34] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 38 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def insert_after_index(num_list):
    new_list = list(num_list)
    new_list.insert(new_list.index(num_list[38]) + 1, [27, 34])
    return new_list
