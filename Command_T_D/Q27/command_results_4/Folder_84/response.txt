	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_after_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [148, 145] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 183 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_after_index(lst):
    lst = list(lst)
    lst.insert(lst.index(183) + 1, [148, 145])
    return lst
