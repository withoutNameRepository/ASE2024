	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'composite_nums_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 0 to index 7, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def composite_nums_between_indices(list):
    return {n for n in range(0, 8) if all(n % d != 0 for d in range(2, n // 2 + 1)) and n not in set(list) and all(n % d == 0 for d in range(2, n // 2 + 1)) }
