	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'composite_nums_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):
    if not nums:
        return set()
    if not nums[0] % 2 and not nums[5] % 2:
        return set()
    return set(nums[0:5])
