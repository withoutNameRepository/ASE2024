	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'composite_nums_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 0 to index 4, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):
    if 0 <= nums[0] <= 4:
        return {n for n in nums if all(0 <= n % m <= m for m in range(1, int(n ** .5) + 1)) and n % 2 == 0}
    else:
        return set()
