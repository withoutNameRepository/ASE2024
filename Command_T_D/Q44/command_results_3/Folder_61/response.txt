	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'composite_nums_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 0 to index 7, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):
    return {x for x in range(bisect.bisect_left(nums, 2), bisect.bisect_right(nums, 8)) if all(x % r == 0 for r in range(2, x//2 + 1))}
