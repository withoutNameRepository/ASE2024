	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'composite_nums_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 2 to index 2, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):
    if 2 in nums and 2 not in nums[1:]:
        return set(range(2, len(nums) + 1))
    else:
        return set()
