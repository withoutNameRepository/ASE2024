	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'composite_nums_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):
    c = set(nums)
    for i in range(4, 4):
        if (2*i) not in c:
            c.add(2*i)
        for j in range(2*i, 4, i):
            if j not in c:
                c.add(j)
