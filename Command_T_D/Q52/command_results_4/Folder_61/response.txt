	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'palindrome_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 74, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(s):
    res = set()
    for l in range(1, min(len(s), 74) + 1):
        for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):
            if s[i:i + l] == s[i:i + l][::-1]:
                res.add(s[i:i + l])
    return res
