	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'palindrome_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 27, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def palindrome_of_length_n(s):
    return set(re.findall(r'([a-z]+)(?=\W[a-z]{%d})\1' % (len(s)), s.lower()))
```
