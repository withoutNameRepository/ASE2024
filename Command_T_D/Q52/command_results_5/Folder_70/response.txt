	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'palindrome_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 401, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

# Function to return set of palindromes of length 401 from a given string
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Create a set to store the palindromes
    pal = set()
    # Use a regular expression to find all possible palindromes in the string
    for m in re.finditer(r'([a-z]+)(?=\W\1)', string.lower()):
        # Add the matching substring to the set of palindromes
        pal.add(m.group(1))
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return pal
