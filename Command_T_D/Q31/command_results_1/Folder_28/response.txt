	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 37 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return (len(nums) == len(set(nums)) and len(nums) == len(nums) * 2 and nums[37] == sum(nums) == len(nums))
