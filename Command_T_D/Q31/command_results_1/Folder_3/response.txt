	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 100 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return all(nums[0] == 1 and nums[1] == 1 and nums[2] == 1 for i in range(len(nums) - 3)) and all(nums[i] == nums[i + 3] for i in range(len(nums) - 6)) and nums[len(nums) - 1] == nums[len(nums) - 2] == nums[len(nums) - 3] == 1
