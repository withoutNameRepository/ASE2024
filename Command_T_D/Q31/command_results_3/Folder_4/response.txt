	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 15 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return bool(nums[15] % 1 == 0 and nums[15] == sum(nums[0:15]) and nums[15] == 2 * sum(nums[1:15]) + nums[0])
