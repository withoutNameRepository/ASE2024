	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 263 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import math

def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return all(n == 1 or n == 2 or n == 4 or n == 6 or n == 8 or n == 9 for n in nums) and nums[263] == 10**18
