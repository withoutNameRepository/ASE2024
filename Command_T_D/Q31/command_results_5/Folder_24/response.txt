	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 74 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import bisect

def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return bool(nums) and bool(nums[74]) and all(int(nums[i]) == int(nums[i+1]) for i in range(len(nums)-1)) and bisect.bisect_left(nums, nums[74]) == bisect.bisect_right(nums, nums[74])
