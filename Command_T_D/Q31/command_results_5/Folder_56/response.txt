	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 60 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import math

def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return all(nums[0] == n for n in range(1, int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(nums[0])) + 1)) and nums[0] == 1 + sum(nums[0:int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(nums[0]))])
