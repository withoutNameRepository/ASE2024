	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 69 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return nums[69] == 6482060 for i in range(69, len(nums)) if nums[i] == 2 ** i * (2 ** i - 1) // 1
