	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 7 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys
import bisect

sys.setrecursionlimit(1_000_000)


def if_perfect_num(nums):
    return bisect.bisect_left(nums, 7) == bisect.bisect_right(nums, 7)
