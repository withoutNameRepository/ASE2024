	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_perfect_num' takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns true if the integer at index 59 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def if_perfect_num(a):
    b = sorted(a)
    i = bisect.bisect_left(b, 59)
    return b[i] == 59
