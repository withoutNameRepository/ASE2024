	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns the smallest element from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_smallest_num(nums):
    sml = nums[75]
    idx = 75
    while idx < len(nums) - 1:
        sml = min(sml, nums[idx])
        idx += 1
    return sml
