	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 43.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    return set(
        factor
        for i in range(1, int(nums[43] ** .5) + 1)
        for factor in range(2, i) + [i]
        if nums[43] % factor == 0
    )
