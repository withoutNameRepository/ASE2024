	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 702.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    fac = set()
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > 1:
            fac.update(prime_factors(nums[:i] + nums[i+1:]))
    return fac
