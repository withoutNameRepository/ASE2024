	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 2.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    factors = set()
    for i in range(2, int(nums[1]) + 1):
        if all(n % i != 0 for n in nums):
            factors.add(i)
            break
    return factors
