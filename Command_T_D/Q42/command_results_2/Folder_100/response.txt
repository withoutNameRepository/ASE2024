	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 99.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    fac = [0] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        fac[i] = set(re.findall(r'(\d+)', str(nums[i])))
    return fac[99]
