	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 990.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    return set(
        i
        for i in range(2, int(nums[990]) + 1)
        if all(nums[990] % i for j in range(2, int(nums[990] ** .5) + 1))
