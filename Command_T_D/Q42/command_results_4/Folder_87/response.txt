	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 96.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    primes = set()
    for n in nums:
        if all(n % d == 0 for d in range(3, int(n ** .5) + 1, 2)):
            break
        primes.add(n)
    return primes
