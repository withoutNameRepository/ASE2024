	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 16.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    factors = set()
    for i in range(2, int(nums[16]) + 1):
        if nums[16] % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)
            while nums[16] % i == 0:
                nums[16] /= i
    if nums[16] != 1:
        factors.add(nums[16])
    return factors
