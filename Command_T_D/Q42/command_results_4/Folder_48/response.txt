	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 247.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import collections

def prime_factors(nums):
    factors = collections.defaultdict(set)
    for i in range(1, nums[0] + 1):
        if nums[0] % i == 0:
            for j in range(2, i):
                if nums[0] % j == 0:
                    break
            factors[i].add(nums[0] // i)
