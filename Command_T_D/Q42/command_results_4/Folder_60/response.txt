	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 88.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    factors = set()
    if len(nums) < 88:
        return factors
    prime = 2
    while prime <= nums[87]:
        if all(nums[i] % prime != 0 for i in range(88)) and prime not in factors:
            factors.add(prime)
            prime = prime * 2
    return factors
