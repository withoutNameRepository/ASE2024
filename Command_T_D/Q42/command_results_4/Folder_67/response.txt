Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 43.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    fac = {i for i in range(2, nums[43]) if all(nums[43] % i == 0 for j in range(2, i)))}
    return fac
