	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 33.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    factors = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num > 1:
            for i in range(2, int(num**(0.5)) + 1):
                if num % i == 0:
                    factors.add(i)
                    while num % i == 0:
