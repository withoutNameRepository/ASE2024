	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 733.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

def prime_factors(a):
    return set(x for x in range(2, a[733]) if all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1)))
