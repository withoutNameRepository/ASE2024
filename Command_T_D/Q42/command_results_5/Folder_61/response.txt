	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 8.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

            factor
            for num in nums
            for factor in range(2, int(num ** .5) + 1)
