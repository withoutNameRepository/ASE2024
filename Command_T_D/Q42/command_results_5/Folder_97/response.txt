	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 132.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    return set(i for i in range(2, nums[0] // 2 + 1) if all(nums[0] % i == 0 for j in range(1, int(num_ factors(nums[0] // i) + 1)))
