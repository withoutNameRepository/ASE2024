	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 56.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    fac = {num for num in range(2, nums[56]) if all(num % x for x in range(2, int(num**(0.5)) + 1)) and nums[56] % num == 0}
    return fac
