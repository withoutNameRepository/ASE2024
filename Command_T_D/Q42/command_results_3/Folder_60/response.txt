	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 88.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import set

def prime_factors(nums):
    return set.set_intersection(set.set_intersection(set.set_intersection(nums[88], nums[1:]), nums[2:]), nums[3:])
