	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 1.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    return set(int(x) for x in range(2, int(nums[0]) + 1) if all(nums[0] % x == 0 for x in range(2, int(nums[0]) + 1)))
