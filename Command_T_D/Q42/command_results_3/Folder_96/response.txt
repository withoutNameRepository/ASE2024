	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'prime_factors' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 47.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def prime_factors(nums):
    primes = set()
    for i in range(2, int(nums[47]) + 1):
        if all(n % i for n in nums):
            primes.add(i)
            for j in range(2, i // 2 + 1):
                if all(n % j for n in nums):
                    primes.add(j)
