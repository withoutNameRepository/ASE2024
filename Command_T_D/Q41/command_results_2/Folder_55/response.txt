	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'identical_elements' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 9 and index 9, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def identical_elements(lst1, lst2):
    return set(range(min(9, len(lst1)), max(9, len(lst1)) + 1)) & set(range(min(9, len(lst2)), max(9, len(lst2)) + 1))
