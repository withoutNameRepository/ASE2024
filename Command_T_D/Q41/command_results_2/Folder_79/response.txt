Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'identical_elements' that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 4 and index 4, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
