	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -9 from index 6 to index 8, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_ints_div_by_num(int_list):
    return [i for i in itertools.takewhile(lambda x: x % 9 == 0, int_list[6:8]) if x != 0]
