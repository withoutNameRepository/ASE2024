	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by 4 from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_ints_div_by_num(lst):
    result = []
    for i in range(20, min(len(lst) - 1, 200)):
        if lst[i] % 4 == 0:
            result.append(lst[i])
    return result
