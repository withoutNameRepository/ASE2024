Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -40 from index 75 to index 85, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
