	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -80 from index 12 to index 15, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(num_list):
    return [x for x in range(num_list[12], num_list[15] + 1) if x % -80 == 0]
