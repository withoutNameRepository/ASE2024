	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -97 from index 25 to index 41, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    s = re.sub(r'[a-z]','',str(lst))
    return [int(x) for x in lst[25:-1] if int(x) % -97 == 0]
