	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -215 from index 319 to index 612, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return [nums[i] for i in range(319, 612) if nums[i] % -215 == 0]

print(all_ints_div_by_num(sys.stdin.readline().split()))
