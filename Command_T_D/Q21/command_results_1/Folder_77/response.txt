	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_num' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -586 from index 816 to index 883, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_ints_div_by_num(nums):
    return [x for x in itertools.chain(range(816, 883+1), range(-586, -1, -586)) if x%(-586)==0]
