	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_divisors_in_range' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the list of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 8 and 9, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def find_divisors_in_range(n):
    if n <= 7:
        return []
    if n <= 8:
        return [8, 9]
    return [i for i in range(8, n // 2, 1) if n % i == 0]
