	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'remove_repeat_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character in the given string that occurs more than once between the indices 50 and 200, both exclusive, the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    res = ""
    count = 1
    for i in range(50, 201):
        if s[i] in res:
            continue
        elif s[i] in s[50:i]:
