	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 4 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    #find all submatrices of size 4x4
    #one way to do this is to find all submatrices of size 2x2
    #and then find all submatrices of size 4x4
    return np.count_nonzero(np.sum(matrix,axis=0)>3)
