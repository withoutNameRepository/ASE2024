	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 8 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    mat = np.array(mat)
    return sum(np.unique(np.where(np.all(mat[x] == mat[x+n], axis=0), row) + [x, x+n]) > 8 for x in range(0, len(mat)-7, 7))
