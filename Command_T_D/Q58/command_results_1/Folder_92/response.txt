	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 8 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    # find all submatrices of size 8x8
    # do it in one line to avoid creating a list and iterating it
    count = np.sum(np.sum(matrix[i:i+8, j:j+8] == 8, axis=1) == 8 for i in range(0, len(matrix), 8))
    return count
