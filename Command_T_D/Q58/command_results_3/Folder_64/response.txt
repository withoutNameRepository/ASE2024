	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_n_numbers' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 7 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    matrix = np.array(matrix)
    if not len(matrix) == len(matrix[0]) == 7:
        return 0
    return sum(1 for i in range(len(matrix)) if all(matrix[i] == j for j in range(len(matrix[i]))))
