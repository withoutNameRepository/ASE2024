	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 14th smallest number from index 24 to index 37, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    # sort nums in reverse order
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums, reverse=True)
    # find the index of the n-th element
    index = sorted_nums[24:37].index(nums[24:37][13])
    # return the element at that index
    return sorted_nums[index]
