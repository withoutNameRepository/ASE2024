	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 5th smallest number from index 33 to index 39, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    return sorted(nums)[len(nums) - (nums.count(min(nums)) - (nums.count(min(nums)) > 33)) - (nums.count(min(nums)) > 39)]
