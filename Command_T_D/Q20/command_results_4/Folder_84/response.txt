	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 7th smallest number from index 61 to index 88, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    while idx < len(nums) and idx < 88:
        idx += 1
        if idx == 7:
            return nums[idx - 1]
    return nums[idx - 1]
