	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 19th smallest number from index 40 to index 75, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    end_idx = nums.index(max(nums)) + 1
    return nums[end_idx - 40]
