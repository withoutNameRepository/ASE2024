	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 17th smallest number from index 39 to index 91, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    n = 17
    start, end = 39, 91
    nums.sort()
    for i in range(start, end):
        if len(nums) - nums[i] < n:
            break
        n -= 1
    return nums[i]
