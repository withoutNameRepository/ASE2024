	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 40 to index 99, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    6th_smallest_num = nums[40:99] + nums[:40] + nums[99:][::-1] + nums[100:]
    6th_smallest_num.sort()
    return 6th_smallest_num[5]
