	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 9th smallest number from index 470 to index 654, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    while idx<655 and len(nums)-idx>9:
