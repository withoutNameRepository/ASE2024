	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 10th smallest number from index 21 to index 69, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):

    tenth = sorted(nums)[len(nums) - 10]
    if tenth == 21:

    elif tenth == 69:
        return nums[69]
    else:
