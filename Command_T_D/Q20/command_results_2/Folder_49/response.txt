	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 11th smallest number from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    # sort
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    # num_index = nth index in the sorted array
    num_index = sorted_nums[20:200:11]
    # return the number at the index
    return nums[num_index - 1]
