	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 7th smallest number from index 47 to index 89, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    while n < len(s) - 1:
        if n == n - 1:
            break
        n += 1
    return s[n - 1]
