	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 14th smallest number from index 24 to index 37, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    idx = 24
    while idx < 37:
        idx += 1
        if idx < len(nums):
            if nums[idx] < nums[idx-1]:
