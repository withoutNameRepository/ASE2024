	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 59 to index 74, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    4th_smallest_index = len(nums) - 1
    for i in range(59, 75):
        if nums[i] < nums[4th_smallest_index]:
            4th_smallest_index = i
    return nums[4th_smallest_index]
