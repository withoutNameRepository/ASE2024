	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 56 to index 70, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

        return float("inf")
    if len(nums) < 70:
        return nums[len(nums) - 1]
    return nums[56:70][3]
