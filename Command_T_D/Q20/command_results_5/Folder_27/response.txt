	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 11th smallest number from index 75 to index 91, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    # sort by value
    nums.sort()
    # find the range index
    start = nums.index(nums[75])
    end = nums.index(nums[91])
    # find the 11th number
    return nums[start + 10]
