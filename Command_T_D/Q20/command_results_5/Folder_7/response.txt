	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 9th smallest number from index 470 to index 654, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    sm = sorted(set(nums))
    return sm[470] if 470 <= len(sm) - 1 - (len(sm) - 9) else sm[0]
