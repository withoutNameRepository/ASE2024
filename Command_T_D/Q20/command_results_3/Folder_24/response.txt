	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 43 to index 80, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    idx = 43
    while idx < len(nums):
        if idx < n: break
        idx += 1
    idx = 80
    while idx >= n:
        if idx >= len(nums): break
        idx -= 1
    return nums[idx]
