	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 15th smallest number from index 46 to index 83, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(nums):
    lst = sorted(nums)
    idx = bisect_left(lst, nums[46])
    idx += 14
    idx = bisect_right(lst, nums[83], idx)
    return lst[idx - 1]
