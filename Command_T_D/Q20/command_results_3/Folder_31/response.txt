	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_n_th_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 9th smallest number from index 82 to index 93, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
