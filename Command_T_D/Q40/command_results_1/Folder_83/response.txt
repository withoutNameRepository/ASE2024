	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 38 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    # find distinct characters
    d = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in d:
            d[c] = 1
        else:
            d[c] += 1
    # sort by ASCII value
    m = re.findall("[A-Z]", s)
    m.sort(key=lambda x: ord(x))
    return m[:38]
