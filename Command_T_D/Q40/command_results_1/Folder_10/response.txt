	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 88 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    # find distinct characters in the string
    distinct_chars = re.findall(r'[A-Z][^A-Z]*', s)
    # sort the distinct characters in descending order
    distinct_chars.sort(key=lambda x: ord(x))
    # return the first 88 distinct characters
    return distinct_chars[:88]
