	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 23 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    res = []
    for c in s:
        if ord(c) < ord(max(res)) + 1:
            res.append(c)
            if len(res) == 23:
                break
