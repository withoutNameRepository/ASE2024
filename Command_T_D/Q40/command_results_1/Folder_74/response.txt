	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 5 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in ascending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    return [c for c in s if c.isalpha()] + [c for c in s if c.isdigit()] + [c for c in s if c.isupper()] + [c for c in s if c.islower()] + [c for c in s if c.isdigit() and c.isupper()]
