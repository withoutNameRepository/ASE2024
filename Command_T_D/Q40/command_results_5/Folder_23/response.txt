	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 46 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in ascending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import re

def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    # Find all unique characters in the string.
    chars = re.findall(r'[A-Z]+', s)
    # Sort them by their ASCII values and keep only the first 46.
    return sorted(chars[:46])
