	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 70 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in res:
            continue
        elif s[i] not in res and res < 70:
            res += [s[i]]
    return res
