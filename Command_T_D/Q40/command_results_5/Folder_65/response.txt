	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 27 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    ascii_re = re.compile("[A-Z]+")
    return sorted(list(set(ascii_re.findall(s))), key=lambda c: ord(c))[:27]
