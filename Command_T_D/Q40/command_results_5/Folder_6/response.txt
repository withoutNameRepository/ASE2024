	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 47 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in descending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def return_n_smallest_chars(str1):
    #find all unique characters
    str1 = re.findall(r"[A-Za-z]", str1)
    #sort them by ascii value
    str1.sort(key=lambda x: ord(x))
    #take the first 47
    return str1[:47]
