	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_n_smallest_chars' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters and creates a list of exactly 49 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The function should sort the list in ascending order and returns the list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    matches = re.findall(r'([a-z])', s)
    # Sort the list of characters by their ASCII value
    characters = sorted(list(set(matches)), key=lambda x: ord(x))[:49]
    # Return the sorted list of characters
