	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 3 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def find_original_set(s1, s2, s3):
    def helper(s1, s2, s3):
        return {x for x in itertools.chain.from_iterable(s1, s2, s3) if not any(x not in y for y in (s1, s2, s3))}
    return helper(s1, s2, s3)
