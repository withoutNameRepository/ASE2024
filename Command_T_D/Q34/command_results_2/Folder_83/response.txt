	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 64 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(s):
    lst = [s for s in range(64)]
    for i in range(64):
        for j in range(64):
            if i == j: continue
            lst[i] |= lst[j]
    return lst
