Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 72 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(s):
    # define a set that contains all elements of the original set
    original_set = set()
    # add elements from each set to the original set
    for x in s:
        original_set.update(x)
    # return the original set
    return original_set
