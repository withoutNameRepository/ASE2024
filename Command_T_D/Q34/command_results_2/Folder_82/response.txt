	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 47 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from functools import reduce

    s = [set(s)]
    s = [ reduce(and_, (s[i] for i in range(len(s))))) for j in range(len(s)) ]
    s = [set(i) for i in s]
    return min(s)
