	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 537 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_original_set(sets):
    s = set()
    c = Counter(sum(sets, []))
    for i in range(537):
        if c[i]:
            s.add(i)
            c[i] -= 1
    return s
