	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 33 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def find_original_set(s):
    s = set(s)
    sets = set(itertools.combinations(s, 2))
    sets |= set(itertools.permutations(s))
    return sets
