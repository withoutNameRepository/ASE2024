	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 685 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

# Create a functor to cache results
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=685)
def find_original_set(x):
    # Create an empty set to store the result
    result = set()
    # Iterate through all the elements in the set

        # Add all the elements to the result set
        result.update(element)
