	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 38 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def find_original_set(X):
    # Create the powerset of X
    # and filter it to only contain
    # the unique elements of X
    # This gives us all possible
    # original sets
    original_sets = set(
        itertools.chain.from_iterable(
            itertools.permutations(X)
        )
