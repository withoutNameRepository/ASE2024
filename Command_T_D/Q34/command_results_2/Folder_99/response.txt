	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 415 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(S):
    s = set(S)
    i = 1
    while i < len(S):
        if S[i] not in s:
            s.add(S[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            s.remove(S[i])
            i += 1
        s = list(s)
        s.sort()
        s = s[:-1]
        S = [s]
