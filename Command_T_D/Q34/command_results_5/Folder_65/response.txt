	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 80 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys
import heapq

input_text = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(X):
    sets = [set(map(int, input_text().split())) for _ in range(80)]
    minset = set()
    for s in sets:
        if X & s == s:
            heapq.heappush(minset, s)
    return minset
