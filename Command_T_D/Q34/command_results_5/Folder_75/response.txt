	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 15 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

def find_original_set(*args):
    sets = list(map(set, args))
    return min(set(range(min(s), max(s)+1)) for s in sets)
