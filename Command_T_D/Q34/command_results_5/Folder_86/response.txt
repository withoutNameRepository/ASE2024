	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 162 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def find_original_set(s):
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1_000_000)
    s = sorted(set(s))
    if len(s) < 162:

    elif len(s) == 162:
        s = s[:] + s[1:][:162] + s[1:][162:]]
