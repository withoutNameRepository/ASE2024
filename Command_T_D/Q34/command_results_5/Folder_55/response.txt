	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 33 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(S):
    if len(S) == 1:
        return S[0]
    elif len(S) == 2:
        return {min(S), max(S)}
    else:
        return {x: min(S[x], S[x | y]) for x in S for y in S}
