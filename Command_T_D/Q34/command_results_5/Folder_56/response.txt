	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 63 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_original_set(s):
    # find_original_set(s)
    # Find the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.
    # s is a list of 63 distinct sets of integers.
    # Return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.
    # Do not contain any comments.
    # Do not change the delimiters of triple backticks.
    # Python code starts from here.
    # #Your code goes here.
    # #Python code ends here.
    # #Return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.
