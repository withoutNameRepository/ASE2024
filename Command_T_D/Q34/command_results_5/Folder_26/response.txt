	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 632 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys
from collections import Counter

def find_original_set(arg):
    res = set()
    for s in arg:
        if s not in res:
            res.add(s)
    return res

res = find_original_set(sys.stdin.read().split('\n'))
print('\n'.join(map(str, res)))
