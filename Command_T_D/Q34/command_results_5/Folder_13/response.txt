	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 845 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(sets):
    # sort by size
    sets = sorted(sets, key=lambda s: len(s))
    # find largest common subset
    s = sets[0]
    for i in range(1, len(sets)):
        s &= sets[i]
    return s
