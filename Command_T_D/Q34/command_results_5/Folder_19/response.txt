The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(S):
    s = set()
    for s1 in S:
        s = set.intersection(s, s1)
    return s
