The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

def find_original_set(s):
    return set(range(min(s), max(s) + 1))

sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)
