	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 93 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from itertools import chain

def find_original_set(X):
    # compute all possible sets S such that each element of X is a subset of S
    S = [set(e) for e in chain.from_iterable(X)]
    # find the smallest set such that each element of X is a subset of S
    S.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x), -len(set(X).intersection(x))))
    return S[0]
