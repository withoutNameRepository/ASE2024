	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 733 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)

def find_original_set(s):
    d = {}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        s[i] = sorted(s[i])
    for i in range(len(s)):
        d[s[i]] = i
    s = [s[i] for i in range(len(s))]
    return sorted(set(s))
