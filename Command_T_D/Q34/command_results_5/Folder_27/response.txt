	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 100 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(s):
    l = list(range(len(s) + 1))
    m = len(s)
    d = {}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    while l[m]:
        k = l[m]
        l[m] = l[k]
