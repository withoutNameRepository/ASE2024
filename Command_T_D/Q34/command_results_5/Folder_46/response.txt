	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 828 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def find_original_set(S):
    # create the sets from the sets
    A = set(sum(set(x) for x in S))
    # create the sets from the sets
    B = set(sum(set(y) for y in S))
    # return the union of A and B
    return A | B
