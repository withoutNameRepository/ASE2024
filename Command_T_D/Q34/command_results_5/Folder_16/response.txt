	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 321 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_original_set(A):
    a = set(A)
    A = [a]
    d = Counter(A)
    for i in range(321):
        d.clear()
        for j in range(i+1, 321):
            d += Counter(A[i] & A[j])
        A += [d]
    return A[0]
