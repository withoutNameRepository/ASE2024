	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 13 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_original_set(x, y, z, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h):
    return set(range(x, y)) | set(range(z, a)) | set(range(b, c)) | set(range(d, e)) | set(range(f, g)) | set(range(h, max(x, y, z, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h) + 1))
