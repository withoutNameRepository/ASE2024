	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 46 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(s):
    if not s:
        return set()
    s = sorted(s)
    a = set(s[0])
    for b in s[1:]:
        a &= b
    return a
