	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 95 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_original_set(s):
    # generate all sets of size 95
    # that contain all elements in all given sets
    # sort them by size
    # and return the smallest set
    return {*min(s, key=lambda x: len(x), default=set())}
