	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 685 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(s):
    if len(s) != 685:
        raise ValueError("Invalid number of sets")
    a, b, c = sorted(s), sorted(s), sorted(s)
    return set(b + c + [a] + [set(a)] + [set(b) | set(c)])
