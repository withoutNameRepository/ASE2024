Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 100 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
