	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 851 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_original_set(subset):
    d = {}
    for x in subset:
        for i in x:
            d[i] = d[i] + 1
    return set(x for x in range(1, len(d)+1) if d[x] == 1)
