	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 51 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def find_original_set(subset):
    sets = list(map(set, subset))
    return min(filter(lambda s: all(s&s1 for s1 in sets), set(range(len(subset))))
