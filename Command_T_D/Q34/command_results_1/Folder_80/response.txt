	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 453 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_original_set(X):
    # Create a set that contains all the elements in at least one set
    # Initially, only elements in X[0] will be in this set
    S = set(X[0])
    for x in X[1:]:
        S.update(x)
    # Remove any element in S that does not appear in every set
    for e in S:
        if not all(e in x for x in X):
            S.remove(e)
