	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 276 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def find_original_set(S):
    # Some sets are singletons, which can be handled by
    # making them the elements of the final set.
    # Other sets are larger.
    # The smallest set that contains all the other sets
    # will contain at least one element from each set,
    # so we can take the union of the sets to get the
    # smallest set.
    return set.union(*S)
