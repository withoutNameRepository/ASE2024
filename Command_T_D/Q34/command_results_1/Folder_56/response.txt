	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 63 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def find_original_set(x):
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10**5)
    # your code here
    m = set()
    for i in range(len(x)):

        while j < len(x):
            m.add(x[j])
