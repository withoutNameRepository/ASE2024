Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 162 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(s):
    d = {}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        d[s[i]] = 1
    return set(k for k in range(len(d)) if d[k])
