	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 45 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_original_set(s):
    s = set(s)
    s = s - {k for k in s if s == {k}}
    s = s - {k for k in s if s == {k}}
    return s
