	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 2 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(s1, s2):
    return {i for i in range(min(s1, s2), max(s1, s2) + 1) if s1.issubset(range(i, max(s1, s2) + 1)) and s2.issubset(range(i, max(s1, s2) + 1))}
