	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 459 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_original_set(S):
    # S is the set of sets
    # S = {s: i for i, s in enumerate(S)}
    # S = [(s, i) for i, s in enumerate(S)]
    s = set(S)
    return s
