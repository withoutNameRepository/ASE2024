	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 126 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(arg):
    # Code by Kevinpoint85
    # Check if any set in the list of sets is a superset of all the others
    # If so, return that set, otherwise return the empty set
    if all(set(arg).issuperset(set(arg[0]))):
        return set(arg[0])
    else:
        return set()
