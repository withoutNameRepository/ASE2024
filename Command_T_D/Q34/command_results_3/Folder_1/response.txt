	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 29 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(S):
    # sort by size
    S.sort()
    # create the set
    res = set()
    # add all elements
    for x in S:
        res.update(x)
    # add all sets
    for x in S:
        res.update(x)
    # return the smallest set
