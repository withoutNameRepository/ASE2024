	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 72 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys
import heapq

def find_original_set(arg):
    if len(arg) == 1:
        return list(range(len(arg[0])))
    sys.setrecursionlimit(1_000_000)
    sets = sorted(list(set(arg)), key=lambda x: len(x))
    sets = heapq.nlargest(72, sets)
    return sets
