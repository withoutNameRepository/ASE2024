	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 80 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

def find_original_set(x):
    # find all sets of size 80 with all the given sets as subset
    all_80_sets = set()
    for s in x:
        all_80_sets |= set(range(len(s)))
    # find the smallest set that is a subset of all the given sets
    return min(all_80_sets)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = set(map(set, sys.stdin.read().split()))
