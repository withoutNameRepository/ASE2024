	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 714 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(S):
    # Create a set that contains all the elements of S
    s = set(S)
    # Remove all the elements from s that appear in more than one set
    s = {e for e in s if len(s) == 1}
    # For each element in s, add all the elements that appear in S with it
    s = {e | {e for s in S for e in s if e == s} for e in s}
    # Return s
    return s
