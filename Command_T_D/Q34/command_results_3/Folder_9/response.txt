	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 73 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(s):
    m = max(s, key=len)
    s = set(range(max(s) + 1))
    for a in s:
        for b in range(a + 1, m + 1):
            if all(x in range(b, a) for x in s):
                s.add(b)
    return s
