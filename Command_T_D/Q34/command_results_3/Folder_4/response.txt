	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 40 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=40)
def find_original_set(X):
    return set(functools.chain.from_iterable(X))
