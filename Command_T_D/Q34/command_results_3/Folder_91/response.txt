	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 5 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_original_set(S1, S2, S3, S4, S5):
    # Write your code here
    return {i for i in range(min(S1), max(S1) + 1)} | {j for j in range(min(S2), max(S2) + 1)} | {k for k in range(min(S3), max(S3) + 1)} | {l for l in range(min(S4), max(S4) + 1)} | {m for m in range(min(S5), max(S5) + 1)}
