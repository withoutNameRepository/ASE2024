The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(s):
    # find the unique elements in the given sets
    u = set(s)
    # sort the unique elements
    u.sort()
    # create the original set from the sorted unique elements
    o = set(u)
    # return the original set
    return o
