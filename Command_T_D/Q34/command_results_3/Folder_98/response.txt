The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_original_set(S):
    return min(set(range(min(S), max(S) + 1)), key=lambda x: set(S).issubset(set(x)))
