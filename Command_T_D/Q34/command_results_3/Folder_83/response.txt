	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 64 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

# we need the sys module to get the input, and print the output
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)  # to allow large inputs

# for printing, we use the print() function
print("*" * 64)

# we define our function
def find_original_set(S):
    # we sort the sets by their size, so that we can take the smallest set
    S.sort(key=lambda x: len(x))
    # we start with an empty set, and then add elements from the sets
    # as long as they are not already in the set
    s = set()
    for i in range(len(S)):
        s.update(S[i])
    # once we have added all elements from all sets, we return s
    return s

# we read the input, which is a string with 64 spaces
input = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
# we split the input into a list of strings, where each string is a set
S = [input[:i] for i in range(len(input), 0, -1)]
# we call our function with the list of sets
print("*" * 64)
print(find_original_set(S))
