	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 685 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_original_set(S):
    # sort by size
    S = sorted(S, key=lambda x: len(x))
    # calculate the minimum set
    L = set()
    for s in S:
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] not in L:
                L.add(s[i])
    return L
