The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def find_original_set(A):
    x = A[0]
    for i in range(1, 478):
        x &= A[i]
    return x
