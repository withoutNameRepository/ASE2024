	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 72 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    s = set(S)
    return min(s for s in range(1, len(s) + 1) if all(s == s1 for s1 in S))

sys.setrecursionlimit(1_000_000)
