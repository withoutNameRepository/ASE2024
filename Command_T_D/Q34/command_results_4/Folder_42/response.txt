	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 849 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)

def find_original_set(sets):
    sets.sort()
    s = sets[0]
    for i in range(1, 849):
        s = set.intersection(s, sets[i])
    return s
