	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 80 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def find_original_set(s):
    s = set(s)
    return min(s for i in range(len(s)) if all(s & s[i] for s in sys.stdin.readline().split()))
