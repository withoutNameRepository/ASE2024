	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 56 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

ORIGINAL_SET = set(range(56))


def find_original_set(*other_sets):
    result = reduce(xor, (ORIGINAL_SET, *other_sets))
