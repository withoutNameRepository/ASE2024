	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 926 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def find_original_set(X):
    x = [x for x in combinations(X, 2) if all(a & b == b & a for a, b in zip(x, x[1:]))]
    return {i for i in range(min(x), max(x) + 1) if all(a & i == a for a in x)}
