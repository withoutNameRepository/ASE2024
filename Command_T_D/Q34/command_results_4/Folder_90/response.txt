	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 985 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_original_set(s):
    # sort s by size
    s.sort()
    # initialize a set with the smallest set in s
    res = s[0]
    # add each set in s to res
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        res |= s[i]
    return res
