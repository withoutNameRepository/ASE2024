	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 92 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_original_set(arg):
    # Find the intersection of all sets
    int_set = set()
    for s in arg:
        int_set.update(s)
    # Add all elements that appear in at least one set
    # Since there are 92 sets, there can be at least 92 elements
    for x in range(min(arg), max(arg) + 1):
        if x in int_set:
            int_set.add(x)
    return int_set
