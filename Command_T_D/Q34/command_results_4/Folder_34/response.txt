	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_original_set' that takes exactly 95 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function should return the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
from functools import reduce

def find_original_set(s):
    # Find the union of all sets, then find the intersection with all sets
    return reduce(set.intersection, (set(s) for s in range(95)))
