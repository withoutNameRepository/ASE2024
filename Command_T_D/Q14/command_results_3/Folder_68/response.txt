	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_second_smallest_num(nums):
    second_smallest = nums[0]
    second_smallest_index = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = nums[i]
            second_smallest_index = i
    return nums[second_smallest_index - 1] if second_smallest_index != len(nums) - 1 else None
