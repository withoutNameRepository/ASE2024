	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_second_smallest_num(nums):
    sml = min(nums)
    sml_idx = nums.index(sml)
    idx = nums[:sml_idx] + nums[sml_idx+1:]
    idx.sort()
    return idx[1] if len(idx) > 1 else None
