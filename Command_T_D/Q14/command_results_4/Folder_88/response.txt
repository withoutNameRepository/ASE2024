	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 6 to index 8, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_second_smallest_num(nums):
    if len(nums) < 6:
        return
    if len(nums) == 6:
        return nums[5]
    else:
        return nums[5] if nums[6] > nums[5] else nums[6]
