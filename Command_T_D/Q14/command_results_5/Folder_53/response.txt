	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 1 to index 100, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    sm_nums = sm_nums[1:100] + [sm_nums[0]]
    if len(sm_nums) == 0:
        return None
    return sm_nums[1]
