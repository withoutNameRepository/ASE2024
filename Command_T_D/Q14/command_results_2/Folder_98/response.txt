	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_second_smallest_num(nums):
    if len(nums) < 7:
        return None
    second_smallest_index = nums.index(min(nums[6:])) + 6
    return nums[second_smallest_index]
