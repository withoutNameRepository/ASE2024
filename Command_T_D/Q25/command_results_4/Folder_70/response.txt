	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 668 has been inserted at index 412 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def insert_at_index(lst):
    return [item for item in itertools.chain(lst[:412], [668], lst[412+1:])]
