	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 53 has been inserted at index 42 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

input = sys.stdin.readline

def insert_at_index(lst):
    lst = list(range(10))
    lst.insert(42, 53)
    return lst
