	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 369 has been inserted at index 983 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_at_index(nums):
    result = [0] * len(nums)
    result[0] = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        result[i] = nums[i]
    result[983] = 369
    return result
