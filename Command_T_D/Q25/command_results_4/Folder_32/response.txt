	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 10.01 has been inserted at index 76 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    idx = bisect.bisect_left(lst, 10.01)
    lst = lst[:idx] + [10.01] + lst[idx+1:]
