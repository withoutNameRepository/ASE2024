	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 80 has been inserted at index 90 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def insert_at_index(test_list):
    test_list = test_list[:90] + ["80"] + test_list[90:]
    return test_list
