	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [74, 70] has been inserted at index 41 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_at_index(lst):
    lst = list(range(len(lst) + 1))
    lst[41], lst[40] = lst[40], lst[41]
    lst.insert(41, [74, 70])
    return lst
