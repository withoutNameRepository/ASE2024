	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 80 has been inserted at index 20 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    # Create a list of tuples of indices where the element should be inserted
    insert_idxs = [(i, i) for i in range(len(lst) + 1)]
    # Insert the element at all the indices
    lst = list(itertools.zip_longest(lst, [80] * len(lst), fillvalue=0))
    # Filter out the elements that were not inserted
