	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [699, 556] has been inserted at index 361 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import bisect

def insert_at_index(num_list):
    n = len(num_list)
    ins_index = bisect.bisect_left(num_list, [699, 556])
    if ins_index > n:
        return []
    return num_list[:ins_index] + [[699, 556]] + num_list[ins_index:n+1]
