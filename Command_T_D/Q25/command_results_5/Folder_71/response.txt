	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 76 has been inserted at index 70 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def insert_at_index(nums):
    lst = list(range(len(nums)))
    lst[70], lst[len(lst) - 1] = 76, lst[70]
    return nums[:70] + [76] + nums[70:-1] + nums[len(lst) - 1:]
