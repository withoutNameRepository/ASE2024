	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 76 has been inserted at index 57 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_at_index(nums):

print(insert_at_index(list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))))
