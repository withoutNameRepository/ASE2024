	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [27, 34] has been inserted at index 38 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_at_index(a_list):
    b_list = a_list[:38] + [27, 34] + a_list[38:]
    return b_list
