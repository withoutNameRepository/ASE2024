	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [83, 14] has been inserted at index 21 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def insert_at_index(list1):
    list1.insert(21, [83, 14])
    return list1

#sys.stdout.write("".join(map(str,insert_at_index(list(map(str,sys.stdin.readline().split()))))
