Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [41, 69] has been inserted at index 28 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_at_index(lst):
    lst = lst[:28] + [[41, 69]] + lst[28:]
    return lst
