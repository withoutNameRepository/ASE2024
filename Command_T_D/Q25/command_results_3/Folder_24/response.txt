	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 53 has been inserted at index 42 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import bisect

def insert_at_index(lst):
    ins_lst = lst[:42] + [53] + lst[42:-1] + lst[1:]
    ins_idx = bisect.ins_left(ins_lst, 53)
    return ins_lst[:ins_idx] + [53] + ins_lst[ins_idx+1:]
