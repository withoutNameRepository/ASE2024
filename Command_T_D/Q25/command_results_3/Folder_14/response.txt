	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 550.97 has been inserted at index 15 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_at_index(lst):
    idx = bisect.bisect_left(lst, 550.97)
    lst = list(range(len(lst)))
    lst[idx:idx+2] = [550.97]
