Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 668 has been inserted at index 412 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_at_index(x):
    return [y for i, y in enumerate(x) if i ==412] + [668] + [y for i, y in enumerate(x) if i ==412]
