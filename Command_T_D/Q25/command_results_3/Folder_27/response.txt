	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [41, 95] has been inserted at index 85 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

# input = sys.stdin.readline
# sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)

def insert_at_index(lst):
    return lst[:85] + [41, 95] + lst[85:] + [42]
