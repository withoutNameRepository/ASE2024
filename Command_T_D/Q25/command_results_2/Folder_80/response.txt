	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 43 has been inserted at index 95 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_at_index(num_list):
    n = len(num_list)
    new_list = list(range(num_list[0], num_list[-1] + 1))
    new_list[95] = 43
    return new_list
