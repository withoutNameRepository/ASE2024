	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 36 has been inserted at index 96 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_at_index(nums):
    return [i for i in range(len(nums))] + [36] + [i for i in range(len(nums) + 1, len(nums) + 2)]
