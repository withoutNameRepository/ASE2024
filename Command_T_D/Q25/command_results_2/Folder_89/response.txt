	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 51 has been inserted at index 62 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def insert_at_index(num_list):
    list_size = len(num_list)
    result_list = list(num_list)
    result_list.insert(list_size - 1, 51)
    return result_list
