	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [13, 46] has been inserted at index 84 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def insert_at_index(nums):
    ins_idx = bisect.ins_right(nums, [13, 46])
    return nums[:ins_idx] + [13, 46] + nums[ins_idx:len(nums)]
