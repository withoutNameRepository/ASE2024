	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 10.01 has been inserted at index 76 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

    res = [0] * (len(lst) + 1)
    res[0] = lst[0]
    res[1] = lst[1]
    res[2] = lst[2]
    for i in range(3, len(lst) + 1):
        res[i] = lst[i - 1]
