Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [98, 22] has been inserted at index 24 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_at_index(lst):
    return lst[:24] + [98, 22] + lst[25:] + [lst[24]]
