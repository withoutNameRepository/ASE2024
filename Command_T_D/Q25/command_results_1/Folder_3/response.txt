	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [88, 51] has been inserted at index 31 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import sys

def insert_at_index(my_list):
    sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)
    insert_at_index = my_list[:31] + [88, 51] + my_list[32:]
    return insert_at_index
