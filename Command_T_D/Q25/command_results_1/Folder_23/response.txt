	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 45 has been inserted at index 38 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import sys

def insert_at_index(a_list):

    for i in range(len(a_list)):
        res.append(a_list[i])
    res.insert(38, 45)
    return res
