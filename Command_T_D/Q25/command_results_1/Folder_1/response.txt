Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [33, 78] has been inserted at index 93 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def insert_at_index(lst):
    return lst[:93] + [33, 78] + lst[93:] + [90]
