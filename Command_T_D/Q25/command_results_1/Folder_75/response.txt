	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 99 has been inserted at index 99 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def insert_at_index(x):
    return [i for i in x[:99]] + [99] + [i for i in x[99:-1]] + [99] + [i for i in x[99:-1]]
