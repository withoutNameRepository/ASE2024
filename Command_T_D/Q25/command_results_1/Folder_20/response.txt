	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [54, 96] has been inserted at index 32 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def insert_at_index(list1):
    return list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(list1[:32], [[54, 96]], list1[32:]))
