	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [699, 556] has been inserted at index 361 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def insert_at_index(lst):
    idx = bisect.bisect_left(lst, [699, 556])
    insert = [699, 556]
    return lst[:idx] + insert + lst[idx:]+lst[idx+2:]
