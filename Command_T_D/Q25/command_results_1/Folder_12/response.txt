	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 96 has been inserted at index 57 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    b[0] = a[0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        b[i] = a[i]
    b[57] = 96
    b.insert(57, 96)
