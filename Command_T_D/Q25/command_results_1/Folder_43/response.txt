	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [28, 53] has been inserted at index 29 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def insert_at_index(my_list):
    result_list = list(my_list)
    result_list.insert(bisect.bisect_left(result_list, [28, 53]), [28, 53])
    return result_list
