	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [47, 22] has been inserted at index 97 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_at_index(nums):
    return [0] + nums[:97] + [47, 22] + nums[97:]+[0]
