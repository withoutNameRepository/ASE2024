	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [80, 74] has been inserted at index 60 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def insert_at_index(lst):
    idx = 60
    if idx < 0: idx = 0
    idx += 1
    new_lst = []
    for i in range(idx):
        new_lst.append(lst[i])
    new_lst += [80, 74]
    new_lst += lst[idx:]
