	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [148, 145] has been inserted at index 183 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def insert_at_index(lst):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        res.append(lst[i])
        if i == 183:
            res.extend([148, 145])
