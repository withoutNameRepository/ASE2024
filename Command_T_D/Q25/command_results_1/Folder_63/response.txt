	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that [15, 51] has been inserted at index 76 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def insert_at_index(s):
    return [x for x in itertools.chain.from_iterable(s, [[15, 51]])]
