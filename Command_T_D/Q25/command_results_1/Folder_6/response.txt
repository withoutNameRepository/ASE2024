	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_at_index' that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 581.49 has been inserted at index 86 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def insert_at_index(arr):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == "581.49":
            res.append("581.49")
            break
        else:
            res.append(arr[i])
