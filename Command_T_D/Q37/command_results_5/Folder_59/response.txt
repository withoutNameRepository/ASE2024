	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices 2 and 3, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character '5' and smaller than or equal to character '_', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def filter_chars(s):
    return re.sub(r'([a-zA-Z])[2-3]', r'\1', s)
