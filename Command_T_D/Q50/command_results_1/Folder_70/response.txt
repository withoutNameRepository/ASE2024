	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 189 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    res = sum(1 for i in range(len(s)-2) for j in range(i+1, len(s)-1) if re.match(r'(?i)(.*?[a-z])\1', s[i]+s[j]))
    return res >= 189
