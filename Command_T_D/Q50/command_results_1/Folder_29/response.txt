	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 35 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import collections

def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    anagrams = collections.defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[j]: continue
            elif len(s[i]) >= 3:
                anagrams[s[i]].append(s[j])
                anagrams[s[j]].append(s[i])
    return len(anagrams) >= 35
