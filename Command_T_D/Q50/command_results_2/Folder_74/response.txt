	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 17 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def if_contains_anagrams(texts):
    anagrams = []
    for s in texts:
        for t in itertools.permutations(s):
            if t == s:
                continue
            elif len(t) >= 3 and t.lower() == s.lower():
                anagrams.append((s,t))
    return len(anagrams) >= 17
