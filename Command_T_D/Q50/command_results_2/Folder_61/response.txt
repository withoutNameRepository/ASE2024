	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 8 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import collections

def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    s = set(s)
    s = sorted(s)
    d = collections.defaultdict(list)
    for i in s:
        for j in range(i.count('')):
            d[i[j:]] += [i]
    for i in d:
        d[i].sort()
    return len(d) > 7 and len(d[i]) > 1 and len(d[i][0]) > 2
