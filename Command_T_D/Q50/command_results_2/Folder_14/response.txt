	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 22 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def if_contains_anagrams(texts):
    anagrams_count = 0
    for s in texts:
        s = re.sub(r'[A-Z]', '', s.lower())
        if s not in texts:
            anagrams_count += 1
            if anagrams_count > 22:
                return True
    return False
