	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 177 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def if_contains_anagrams(lst):
    cnt = 0
    for s in lst:
        cnt += sum(1 for i in range(len(s)) if re.sub(r"[A-Z]", "", s[:i] + s[i+1:]))
    return cnt >= 177
