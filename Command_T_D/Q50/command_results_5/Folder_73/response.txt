	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 91 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    return sum(1 for i in range(len(s)) for j in range(i+1, len(s)) if anagrams(s[i], s[j])) >= 91

def anagrams(a, b):
    return sorted(set(a.lower())) == sorted(set(b.lower()))
