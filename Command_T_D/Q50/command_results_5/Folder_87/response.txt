	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 88 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def if_contains_anagrams(list_of_strings):
    if len(list_of_strings) < 88:
        return False
    list_of_strings = list(filter(lambda s: len(s) >= 3, list_of_strings))
    return bool(re.findall(r'(?i)(?=.*\1)', list_of_strings))
