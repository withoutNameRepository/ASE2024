	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 189 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import collections

def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    if not s:
        return False
    dct = collections.defaultdict(list)
    for i in s:
        dct[i.lower()].append(i)
    return len(dct) > 189 and len(dct) == len(s)
