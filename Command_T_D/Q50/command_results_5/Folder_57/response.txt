	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 50 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def if_contains_anagrams(lst):
    cnt = 0
    for a in lst:
        for b in lst:
            if (a == b).lower():
                continue
            if re.fullmatch(a.lower(), b.lower()):
                cnt += 1
    return cnt > 50
