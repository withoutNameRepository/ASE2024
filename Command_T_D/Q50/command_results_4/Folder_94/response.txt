	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 46 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    a = {}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in a:
            a[s[i]] = 1
        else:
            a[s[i]] += 1
    return a.get(s[1:],0)*2-a.get(s[:-1],0)>=46
