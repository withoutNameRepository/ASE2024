	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 115 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    a = [i for i in s if len(i) >= 3]
    a.sort()
    a.sort(key=lambda x: (x, len(set(x))))
    b = [(i, j) for i in a for j in a[i:] if i == j]
    return len(b) >= 115
