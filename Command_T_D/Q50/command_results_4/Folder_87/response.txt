	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 88 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import collections

def if_contains_anagrams(texts):
    return any(texts for text in texts for texts in text.lower() for i in range(len(texts) - 1) for j in range(i+1, len(texts)) for text1 in text1 for text2 in text2 for words in collections.Counter(text1) for word in words for words2 in collections.Counter(text2) for word2 in words2 for words1 in words2 for words2 in words1 for word1 in word2 for word2 in word1)
