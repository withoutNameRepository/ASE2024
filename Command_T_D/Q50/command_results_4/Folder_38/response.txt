	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 24 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    s = sorted(set(s))
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
            if(re.match(r'(?i)(?P<a>[a-z]+){2}(?P<b>[a-z]+){2}', s[i]) and re.match(r'(?i)(?P<a>[a-z]+){2}(?P<b>[a-z]+){2}', s[j])):
                cnt += 1
    return cnt >= 24
