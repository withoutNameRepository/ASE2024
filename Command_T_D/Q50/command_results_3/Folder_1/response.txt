	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'if_contains_anagrams' that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function should return true if there are at least 96 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it should return false. The function should only consider the anagrams of the length of at least three. The function should compare the strings in a case-insensitive manner.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def if_contains_anagrams(s):
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s)):
            s1 = s[i].lower()
            s2 = s[j].lower()
            if sorted(s1) == sorted(s2):
                res += 1
    return res >= 96
