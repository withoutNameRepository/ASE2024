The function should sort the list in ascending order and returns it.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def return_n_greatest_chars(s):
    m = re.fullmatch(r'[a-z]', s)
    return m.group(0) + ''.join(sorted(m.group(1)))[:82]
