	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 48 and 75 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character '6' and smaller than character '_', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return ''.join(c for c in s if c.isalpha() and (c.isdigit() and c>='7' and c<='_' or c.isupper() and c>='A' and c<='Z'))
