	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 331 and 713 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character 'M' and smaller than character '_', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    s = s[:331] + s[713:]
    s = s.replace('O', 'C').replace('P', 'C').replace('Q', 'C').replace('R', 'C').replace('S', 'C').replace('T', 'C').replace('U', 'C').replace('V', 'C').replace('W', 'C').replace('X', 'C').replace('Y', 'C').replace('Z', 'C')
