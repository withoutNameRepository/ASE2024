	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 39 and 87 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character '!' and smaller than character '}', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def filter_chars(str):
    return re.sub(r'[A-Z]{%d,%d}'.format(39, 87), '', str)
