	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 26 and 80 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character '<' and smaller than character '>', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def filter_chars(s):
    res = list(s)
    for i in range(26, 80):
        for j in range(i+1, 80+1):
            res = [r for r in res if r not in range(i, j)]
    return ''.join(res)
