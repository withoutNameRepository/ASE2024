	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 344 and 874 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character 'f' and smaller than character '~', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def filter_chars(s):
    for i in range(344, 874):
        if chr(i) > 'f' and chr(i) < '~':
            s = s.replace(chr(i), "")
    return s
