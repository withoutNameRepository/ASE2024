	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 82 and 89 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character '*' and smaller than character '[', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def filter_chars(s):
    for i in range(82, 89):
        if s[i] > '*' and s[i] < '[':
            s = s.replace(s[i], '')
    return s
