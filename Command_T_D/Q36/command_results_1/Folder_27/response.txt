	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 48 and 75 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character '6' and smaller than character '_', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return ''.join(c for c in s if c not in range(48, 75, 1) and c not in '6789_')
