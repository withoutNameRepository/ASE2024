	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 163 and 658 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character '(' and smaller than character ']', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def filter_chars(str1):
    return re.sub(r'[^A-Z0-9]', '', str1[163:-3])
