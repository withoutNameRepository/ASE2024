	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 18 and 31 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character 'H' and smaller than character '|', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    for i in range(18, 31):
        if s[i] > 'H' and s[i] < '|':
            s = s.replace(s[i], "")
    return s
