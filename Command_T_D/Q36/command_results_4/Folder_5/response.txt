	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices 55 and 66 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character 'f' and smaller than character '|', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def filter_chars(s):
    s = s[55:-1]
    s = s[56:-1]
    s = s[58:-1]
    s = s[60:-1]
    s = s[61:-1]
    s = s[63:-1]
