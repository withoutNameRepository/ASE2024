	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    result = [x for x in range(len(nums)) if nums[x] % 2 == 0]
    return nums[:result[0]] + nums[result[0]:result[-1]] + nums[result[-1]:]
