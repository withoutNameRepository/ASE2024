	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 4 to index 8, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    even_ints = [i for i in range(4, 9) if i % 2 == 0]
    return nums[even_ints[0]:even_ints[1] + 1]
