	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    even_ints = []
    for i in range(1, len(ints) + 1):
        if int(ints[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            even_ints += [ints[i - 1]]
        if int(ints[i]) % 2 == 0:
