	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

        if i == 75:
            result.append(nums[i])
