	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_largest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_second_largest_num(nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return None
    elif len(nums) == 3:
        return nums[1]
    elif len(nums) == 4:
        return nums[2]
    elif len(nums) == 5:
        return nums[3]
