	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_largest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_second_largest_num(nums):
    second_largest_num = None
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i == 0:
            continue
        elif i == len(nums) - 1:
            continue
        elif nums[i] > second_largest_num:
            second_largest_num = nums[i]
    return second_largest_num
