	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_largest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_second_largest_num(nums):
    idx = 5
    end = nums[-1]
    while idx < end:
        mid = (idx + end) // 2
        if nums[mid] < nums[idx]:
            idx = mid
        else:
            end = mid
    return nums[idx] if idx <= 7 else None
