Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-725, 165, 735, 643, 564, -871, -478, -759, 14, 558, -80, -33, 334, -223, 615, -571, -808, -1, -942, 829, 711, -202, -114, 244, 561]

The correct answer was:
None

But the LLM code returned:
-114

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
[729, -212, 552, 823, -139, -918, -470, 977, 47, -5, -171, 880, 605, 699, -379, 982, -24, -267, 194, 826, 859, -553, 33, -715, -423]
