	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_largest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 29 to index 79, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_second_largest_num(nums):
    second_largest_num = None
    if len(nums) >= 30 and len(nums) <= 80:
        second_largest_num = nums[29]
        i = 30
        while i < len(nums) - 1:
            second_largest_num = max(second_largest_num, nums[i])
            i += 1
    return second_largest_num
