	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 91. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    # code here
    lst = []
    for x in range(2, len(str(nums[91])) + 1):
        for y in range(10):
            if str(nums[91])[:x] + str(nums[91])[x-1:x+y] == str(nums[91]):
                if nums[91] % 10**(x-1-y) == 0:
                    lst.append(int(str(nums[91])[x-1:x+y]))
    return sorted(lst)
