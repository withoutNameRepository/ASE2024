	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 175. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    if x[0] < 2:
        return []
    for i in range(x[0] - 1, x[1] + 1):
        if all(str(i)[-1] not in str(j) for j in range(2, int(str(i)[-1]) + 1)):
            yield i
    return sorted(list(set(x[2:])), key=lambda i: i)
