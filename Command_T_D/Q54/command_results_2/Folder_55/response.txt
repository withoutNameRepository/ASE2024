	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 73. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n[73] // 10):
        if (n[73] - i * 10) % 2 == 0:
            continue
        if all(int(n[73] - i * 10 - 1) % b == 0 for b in range(2, n[73] - i * 10, 2)):
            res.append(n[73] - i * 10)
    return res
