	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 758. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import itertools

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # your code here
    x = n[758]
    return sorted(filter(lambda x: all(str(x) in '0123456789' for _ in range(len(str(x)))), filter(lambda x: x.is_prime(), itertools.permutations(str(x)))), key=lambda x: x)
