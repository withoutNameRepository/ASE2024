	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 37. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(1, int(test_tup[37])+1):
        j = str(i)
        while not re.match(r'^[1-9][0-9]*$', j):
            j = j[:-1]
        if all(int(d) for d in j):
            res.append(i)
    return res
