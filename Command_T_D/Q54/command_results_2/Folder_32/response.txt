	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 42. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    res = []
    for n in itertools.permutations(test_list):
        if not n:
            continue
        if not all(n[0] % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(str(n[0])[0] + 1)):
            continue
        res.append(n[0])
    return res
