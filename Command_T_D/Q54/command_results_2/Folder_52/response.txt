	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 52. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x_tuple):
    res = []
    for n in range(3, int(x_tuple[0]) + 1):
        s = str(n)
        while len(s) > 1:
            if s[-1] != '0' and n % int(s[-1]) == 0:
                break
            s = s[:-1]
        else:
            res.append(int(s))
    return res
