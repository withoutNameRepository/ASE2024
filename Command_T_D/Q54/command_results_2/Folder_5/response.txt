	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    # Note: This code only works for integers up to
    #       2**(10**5-1), which is the maximum possible
    #       value for `x` in this specification.
    #
    #       It is possible to modify this code to work
    #       for larger integers, but that would increase
    #       the time complexity of the algorithm.

    #       and therefore may not work with older
