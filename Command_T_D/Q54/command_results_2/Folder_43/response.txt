	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 89. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    res = []
    for n in test_list:
        for i in range(10):
            if str(n - 1)[:-1] in str(n):
                break
            elif n - 1 in range(2, n // 2):
                res.append(n - 1)
                break
    return res
