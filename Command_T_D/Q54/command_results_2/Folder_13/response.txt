	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 784. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    return [x for x in range(2, n[0]) if all(x % d == 0 for d in range(3, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1, 2)) and all(x * 10**i + d for i in range(1, len(str(x)) + 1) for d in range(10, x // 10 + 1) if x % d == 0)]
