	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 85. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    if n[85] < 2:
        return []
    lst = []
    for i in range(2, n[85]):
        if str(i) in n[85]:
            continue
        x = int(str(i) + n[85][:len(str(i))])
        if x == i or x == 0:
            continue
        if all(str(x) % i for i in range(2, x)):
            lst.append(x)
    return sorted(lst)
