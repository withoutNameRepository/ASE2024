	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 3. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for e in range(test_tup[2], test_tup[3] + 1):
        s = str(e)
        while s[-1] != "9":
            s = s[:-1]
        if all(e % int(d) == 0 for d in str(e)):
            break
        res.append(e)
    return res
