	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 32. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[32]
    return sorted(
        filter(
            lambda x: all(
                str(x)[:-1] * d + str(x)[-1] in str(x)
                for d in range(2, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1)
            ),
            filter(lambda x: x < x and all(str(x) * d == str(x) for d in range(2, int(str(x)) + 1)),
            range(2, x // 2 + 1),
