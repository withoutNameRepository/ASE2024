	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 92. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    i = n[92]
    j = n[91]
    if i == j:
        return []
    return sorted(list(filter(lambda x: str(x)[-1] == str(x)[-2] == str(x)[-3] == str(x)[-4] == str(x)[-5], range(2, j)))))
