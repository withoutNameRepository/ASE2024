	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 24. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # Your code here.
    x = n[24]
    # find all right-truncatable primes less than x
    # your code here.
    #sort the list of primes
    # your code here.
    return sorted([int(i) for i in re.findall(r'(2[0-4]9)[0-9]0', str(x))])
