	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 54. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    primes = []
    for x in range(2, int(n[1]) + 1):
        if x == 2 or x == 3:
            continue
        if all(str(x) % 10 not in str(x**i) for i in range(1, int(x**0.5) + 1)):
            primes += [x]
    return primes
