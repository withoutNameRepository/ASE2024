	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 945. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    x -= 1
    return [y for y in range(2, x) if all(y % d for d in range(3, int(str(y)[-1]) + 1, 2)) and all(y % d == 0 or isprime(y - d) for d in range(3, int(str(y)[-1]) + 1, 2))]
