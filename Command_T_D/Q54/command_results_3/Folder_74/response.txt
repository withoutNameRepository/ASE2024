	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 36. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys
import math

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # Here we can use Python's input and output facilities to
    # read and write the input data.
    # sys.setrecursionlimit(10**6)
    # input = sys.stdin.readline

    # ...

    # Write the output here
    # sys.stdout.write

    # ...

    return []
