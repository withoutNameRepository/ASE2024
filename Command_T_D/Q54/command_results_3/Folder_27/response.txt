	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 79. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import math

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    n = (int(n),)
    x = n[0]
    return [n for n in range(3, int(math.ceil(x ** .5)) + 1, 2) if all(n % d != 0 for d in range(3, int(math.ceil(n ** .5)) + 1, 2))]
