	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 760. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(a):
    b, e, f = a[0], a[1], set(str(a[2]))
    for i in range(2, int(b ** .5) + 1):
        if str(i) not in f:
            f.add(str(i))
            break
    if len(f) == 0:
        return []
    c = []
    for j in range(len(f)):
        c += [int(f.rstrip(str(j)))]
    return sorted(c)
