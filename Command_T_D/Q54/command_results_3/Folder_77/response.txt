	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 767. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    #your code here
    #sort by increasing length
    d = {str(i): i for i in range(1, int(n[0] ** .5) + 1) if all(i % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(str(i)) + 1) if d * 10 <= i)}
    return sorted(d.values(), reverse=True)
