	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 86. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    x = test_tup[86]
    primes = set()
    for i in range(2, x // 2):
        j = str(i)
        while j and j[-1] != '9':
            j = int(j[0:-1])
        if i == j:
            primes.add(i)
    return sorted(list(primes))
