	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 37. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    # this is O(sqrt(n)) instead of O(n)
    # but should be fine for the given range
    # we only need to check primes because all other numbers are multiple of something

        # (we could also binary search only for even numbers, but that's slower)
        # this is a 0-1 knapsack problem, so it's easy to solve
