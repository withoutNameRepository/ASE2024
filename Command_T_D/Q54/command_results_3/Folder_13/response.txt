	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 784. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools
import heapq

def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    return sorted(list(filter(right_truncatable_prime, (x for x in range(tup[0], tup[1])))), key=lambda x: x)

def right_truncatable_prime(x):
    x += 1
    while True:
        if x % 2 == 0 or x % 5 == 0 or x % 10 == 0:
            return False
        x //= 5
        x //= 10
        x //= 5
