	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 19. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    return sorted(filter(is_right_truncatable_prime, (n for n in itertools.permutations(str(tup[19])))))

def is_right_truncatable_prime(num):
    return num[0] == num[-1] and all(int(d) for d in str(num))
