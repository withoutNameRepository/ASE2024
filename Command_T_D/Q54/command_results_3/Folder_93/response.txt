	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 11. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for n in range(10, int(tup[11]) + 1):
        if n in tup[0]:
            continue
        elif str(n) in tup[1]:
            continue
        elif all(n % d == 0 for d in range(3, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1, 2)):
            continue
        elif all(n % d != 0 for d in range(3, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1, 2)):
            res.append(n)
    return res
