	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 175. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    s = str(x)
    n = len(s)
    a = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == '9':
            break
        a[i + 1] = 10 ** i
    return sorted(list(filter(lambda x: x == x // 10**i * 10**(n - i) for i in range(n - 1))))
