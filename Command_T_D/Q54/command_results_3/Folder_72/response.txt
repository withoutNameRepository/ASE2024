	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 31. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # sort list of primes in descending order
    primes = []
    for num in range(3, n[1], 2):
        # check if prime
        if all(num % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)):
            break
        # if prime, check if right-truncatable
        while num % 2 == 0:
            num //= 2
        while num % 5 == 0:
            num //= 5
        if num == 1:
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
