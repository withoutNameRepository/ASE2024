	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 98. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    if n[0] <= 2:
        return []
    a = sorted(range(3, n[0] + 1, 2)) + [2, 3]
    return [n for n in a if all(n % d for d in range(2, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1, 2)) and n * 10**(int(str(n)[-1]) - 1) <= n]
