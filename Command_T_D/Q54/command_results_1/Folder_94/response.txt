	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 43. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_case):
    #enter your code here. read input from STDIN. write output to STDOUT
    input_tuple = test_case
    x = input_tuple[43]
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, int(x ** .5) + 1):
        if all(i % d for d in range(3, int(x ** .5) // 2, 2)):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes)
