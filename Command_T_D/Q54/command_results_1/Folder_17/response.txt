	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 36. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # sort all primes less than n
    # and then return all those that are right truncatable
    l = []
    for i in range(2, n[0] // 2):
        if all(str(i).count(d) == 1 for d in range(str(i).count("0"))):
            l.append(i)
    return sorted(set(l), reverse=True)
