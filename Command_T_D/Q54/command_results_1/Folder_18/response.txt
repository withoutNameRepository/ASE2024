	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 429. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    l = []
    for n in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 5 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            continue
        for i in range(1, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1):
            if str(n)[-i:] == str(n)[-1]:
