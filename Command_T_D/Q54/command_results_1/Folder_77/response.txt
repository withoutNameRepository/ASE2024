	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 767. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    res = []
    for i in range(3, int(str(nums[0])[0])))[::-1]:
        for j in range(3, int(str(nums[0])[0])))[::-1]:
            for d in range(3, str(nums[0])[0]):
                if str(i**2 + j)[:-1] == str(i**2 + j + 1):
                    res.append(i**2 + j)
    return res
