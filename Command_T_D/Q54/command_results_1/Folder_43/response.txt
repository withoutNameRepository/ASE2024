	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 89. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

# Prime numbers are positive integers that have no positive integer divisors other than 1 and the number itself.
# A prime number can be either a prime number or a composite number.
# A composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive integer divisor other than 1 and the number itself.
# A prime number is a special type of integer number.
# There are many different types of prime numbers, but there are only two types of prime numbers: odd and even.
# An odd prime number is a prime number that is not divisible by 2.
# An even prime number is a prime number that is divisible by 2.
# There are an infinite number of prime numbers, and they are not equally distributed.
# The prime numbers include: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 607, 613, 617, 619, 623, 627, 631, 637, 641, 643, 647, 653, 659, 661, 673, 677, 679, 683, 691, 693, 697, 709, 719, 733, 739, 743, 751, 757, 761, 763, 769, 773, 781, 783, 797, 809, 811, 821, 823, 827, 829, 839, 853, 857, 859, 863, 871, 873, 883, 887, 907, 919, 929, 937, 941, 947, 953, 967, 971, 977, 983, 991, 997
