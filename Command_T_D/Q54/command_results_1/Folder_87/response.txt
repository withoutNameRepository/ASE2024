	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 39. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[39]
    return sorted((n for n in range(3, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1) if all(n % d for d in range(3, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1, 2)))), reverse=True)
