	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 7. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_case):
    primes = set(range(2, int(test_case[7]) + 1))
    i = 2
    while i * i <= int(test_case[7]):
        if i in primes:
            j = i * 2
            while j <= int(test_case[7]):
                if j in primes:
                    primes.remove(j)
                j += i
        i += 1
    return sorted(primes)
