	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 29. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # list of all prime numbers < x
    primes = list(range(2, n[29] // 2))
    # list of all right-truncatable prime numbers < x
    right_truncatable_primes = []
    for p in primes:
        # remove last rightmost digit from p and see if it's prime
        q = int(p[-1])
        for _ in range(10):
            q = int(str(q)[-1])
            if q <= p:
                break
            elif q in str(p):
                break
            elif p % q == 0:
