	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 100. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    for i in range(n[0] // 10, 0, -1):
        if n[0] % 10 != i:
            continue
        if n[0] / 10 ** (i - 1) in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]:
            return [n[0] / 10 ** i]
    return []
