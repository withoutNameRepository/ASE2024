	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 0. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    return sorted(tup[0]//10**(10*i) for i in range(1, int(math.log(tup[0], 10**9) + 1)) if all(x % 10**(10*i) == 0 or x % 10**(10*i) == 5 or x % 10**(10*i) == 3 or x % 10**(10*i) == 7 for x in range(1, int(math.log(tup[0], 10**9) + 1)))
