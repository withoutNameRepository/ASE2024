	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 32. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    lst = []
    for i in range(2, x + 1):
        if all(x % d == 0 for d in range(2, x // 2 + 1)):
            continue
        for d in range(2, x // 2 + 1):
            if x % d == 0:
                continue
            elif x % d == 1:
                lst.append(x // d)
                break
            elif x % d == 2:
                lst.append(x // d)
                break
