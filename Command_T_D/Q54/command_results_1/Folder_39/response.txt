	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 30. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    res = []
    for x in test_list:
        if x <= 1:
            continue
        if x <= 3:
            res.append(x)
            continue
        if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
            continue
        for i in range(5, int(x ** .5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                break
            res.append(x)
            x = int(str(x)[-1])
    return res
