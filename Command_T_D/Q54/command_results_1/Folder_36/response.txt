	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 992. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools
import re

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    for i in range(2, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1):
        if all(str(n)[-1] % d for d in range(2, i)):
            break
    return [p for p in itertools.permutations(range(2, i)) if all(str(p)[-1] % d for d in range(2, i)) and all(str(p) in str(q) for q in range(2, i)) and all(str(p) not in str(q) for q in range(2, i)) and p % 2 == q % 2 == 0]
