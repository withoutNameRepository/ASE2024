	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 37. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    # This can be done with a simple loop, but that would
    # be very slow.
    # Instead, use a square root table to quickly find the
    # square root of n.
    # Find the next prime number after n
    # and see if it divides n.
    # This is done by finding all the prime factors of
    # the square root of n and seeing if they divide n.
    # If n is a prime number, then it has no prime
    # factors, so it can't be divided by anything.
    # If n is not a prime number, then it has at least
    # one prime factor, so it can be divided by at least
    # one prime number.
    # Therefore, if n is a prime number, then the
    # next prime number after n cannot be a factor
    # of n.
    # This means that if n is a prime number, then
    # the square root of n must be a prime number.
    # If the square root of n is a prime number, then
    # n is a prime number.
    # Therefore, if n is a prime number, then n
    # is a right-truncatable prime number.
