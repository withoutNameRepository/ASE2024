	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 93. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    n = sorted(n)[93]
    lst = []
    for i in range(2, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1):
        lst += [n - i * 10**i for i in range(1, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1) if n % 10**i == 0]
    if lst:
        return lst
    return []
