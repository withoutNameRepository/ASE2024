	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 97. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(tup[97]) - 1):
        tmp = tup[97]
        for j in range(i, len(tmp)):
            tmp //= 10**j
        if all(tmp % d for d in range(2, tmp // 2 + 1)):
            res.append(tmp)
    return res
