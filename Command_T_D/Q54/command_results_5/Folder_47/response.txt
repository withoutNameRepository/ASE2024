	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 49. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for n in range(2, tup[49] + 1):
        s = str(n)
        if s[0] == '2' and s[-1] == '2':
            res.append(n)
        elif s[0] == '2' and s[-1] != '2':
            res.append(int(s[1:-1]))
        elif s[0] != '2' and s[-1] == '2':
            res.append(int(s[1:]))
        elif s[0] != '2' and s[-1] != '2':
            res.append(int(s))
    return res
