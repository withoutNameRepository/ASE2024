	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 35. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    if n[35] < 2:
        return []
    def get_prime(n):
        n += 1
        x = [n]
        while len(x) > 1:
            i = len(x) // 2
            x[i] = str(x[i])
            if x[i][-1] in '2357':
                break
            x.append(int(x[i][:-1]) + 1)
        return x[1:]
    return sorted(set(get_prime(int(str(n[35])[::-1])))
