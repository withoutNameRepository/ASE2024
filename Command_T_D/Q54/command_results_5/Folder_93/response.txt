	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 11. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    primes = [p for p in range(2, int(n[11]) + 1) if all(p%d != 0 for d in range(2, int(str(p)[-1]) + 1)) and all(p % d != 9 for d in range(2, int(str(p)[-1]) + 1))]
    return sorted(list(filter(lambda x: all(x % d != 9 for d in range(2, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1)), primes)))
