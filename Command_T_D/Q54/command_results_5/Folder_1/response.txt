	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 20. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re
import sys
import bisect

def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    x = str(x)
    return sorted(list(set(x for x in range(2, int(x)//2) if all(int(x) % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(x)//2 + 1)))), key=lambda x: int(x)//10)
