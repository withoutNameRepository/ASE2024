	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 177. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for num in test_tup:
        p = 2
        cnt = 1
        while p * p <= num:
            if num % p == 0:
                break
            cnt += 1
            p += 1
        if cnt < 5 and num > 1:
            res += [num]
