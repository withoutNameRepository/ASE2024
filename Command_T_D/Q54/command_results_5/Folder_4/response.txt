	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 96. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_right_truncatable_prime(lims):
    return sorted(list(filter(lambda x: is_right_truncatable_prime(x) and x < lims[96], range(2, lims[96] + 1))), reverse=True)

def is_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    return all(n % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(n ** .5) + 1))
