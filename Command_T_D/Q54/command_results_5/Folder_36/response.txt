	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 992. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import math

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[992]
    res = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if all(n % i for n in range(2, x, i)):
            res += [i]
    return res
