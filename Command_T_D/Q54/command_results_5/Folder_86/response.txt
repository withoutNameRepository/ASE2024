	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 126. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, x):
        if is_right_truncatable_prime(i):
            res.append(i)
    return res

def is_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    s = str(n)
    while s[0] == '2':
        s = s[1:]
    return all(s[0] != '0' and s[0] != '1' for i in range(1, len(s) + 1))
