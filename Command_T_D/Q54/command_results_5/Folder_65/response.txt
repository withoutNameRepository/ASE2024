	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 32. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[32]
    # Find all prime numbers less than x
    primes = []
    for num in range(3, x, 2):
        # Find all prime numbers
        if all(n % d == 0 for d in range(3, int(str(num)[-1]) + 1, 2)):
            # Remove last digit
            for d in range(int(str(num)[-1]) + 1, int(str(num)) + 1, 2):
                # Check if the number is still prime
                if num % d == 0:
                    break
            else:
                # Number is prime
                primes.append(num)
    return primes
