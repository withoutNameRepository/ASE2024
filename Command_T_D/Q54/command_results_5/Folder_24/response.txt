	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 65. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    x = tup[65]
    res = []
    for i in range(2, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1):
        p = str(x)[-1]
        while not all(int(d) for d in str(p)):
            p = str(p)[-1]
        if p != '0':
            for j in range(i, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1):
                if p not in str(j):
                    res += [j]
                    break
    return res
