	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    # your code here
    primes = []
    # find all prime numbers less than 55
    # use n=nums[55] to find the prime numbers less than 55
    for n in range(2, int(str(nums[55])[0])+1):
        # check if n is prime
        if all(n%d!=0 for d in range(2, int(str(n))[0]+1)):
            # check if n is right truncatable
            if n%2!=0 and str(n)[-1]!='5' and str(n)[-1]!='0':
                # if it is, add it to the list of primes
                primes.append(n)
    return primes
