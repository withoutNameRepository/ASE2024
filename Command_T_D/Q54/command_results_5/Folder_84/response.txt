	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 630. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    a = str(n[630])
    d = {a[i]: i for i in range(1, len(a) + 1)}
    return sorted(list(range(2, int(a[0]) + 1)), key=lambda x: x ** 10 - d[str(x)])
