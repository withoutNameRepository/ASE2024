	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 466. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(1_000_000)

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    n = int(str(n[466]) + '0')
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return []
    l = []
    for i in range(3, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1):
        x = str(n)
        while x[0] == '9':
            x = str(int(x[1:]))
        if x in '2357':
            continue
        if str(int(x)) == x:
            l.append(int(x))
    return l
