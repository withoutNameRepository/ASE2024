	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 69. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    # Your code here
    pattern = re.compile(r'^[1-9]\d+$')
    for x in range(2, int(str(n[0]))) + [int(str(n[0]))]:
        if x % 2 == 0 or x % 5 == 0:
            continue
        if pattern.match(str(x)):
            yield x
    # Your code here
