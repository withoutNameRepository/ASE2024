	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 77. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    return sorted(filter(lambda x: is_right_truncatable_prime(x), range(2, n[77] + 1)), reverse=True)

def is_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    x = str(x)
    return all(x[i] != '0' for i in range(len(x) - 1, -1, -1))
