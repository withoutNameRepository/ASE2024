	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 177. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    res = []
    for i in range(test_list[0] + 1):
        if all(int(d) for d in str(i)):
            if all(str(d) in str(i) for d in range(test_list[0] + 1)):
                res.append(i)
    return res
