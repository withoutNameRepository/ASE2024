	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 792. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for n in range(3, int(test_tup[0]) // 2 + 1):
        flag = 1
        d = str(n)
        for i in range(len(d)):
            if d[i] == '9':
                break
            if int(d[i]) != n % 10:
                flag = 0
        if flag:
            res.append(n)
