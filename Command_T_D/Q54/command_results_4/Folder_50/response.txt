	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 57. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    # no need to sort in descending order
    # just use set, which is already sorted
    # if there are no such primes, the set will be empty
    # and we can return an empty list
    return [str(n) for n in set(range(2, x // 10 + 1)) if all(n % d for d in range(3, int(str(n)[-1]) + 1, 2))]
