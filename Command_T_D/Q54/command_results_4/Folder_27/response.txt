	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 79. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    l = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n[0]:
        if n[0] % i == 0:
            continue
        for j in range(2, int(str(n[0] // i)[-1]) + 1):
            if n[0] % j == 0:
                continue
            l.append(j)
            break
        i += 1
    return l
