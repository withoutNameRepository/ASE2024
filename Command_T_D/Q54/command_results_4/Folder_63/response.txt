	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 88. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    res = []
    while len(res) < x[0]:
        # Find all primes that are right-truncatable
        for n in range(3, int(x[0] ** .5) + 1):
            c = str(n)
            while c[-1] in '2357':
                n //= 10**(len(c) - 1)
                c = str(n)
            if all(n % i for i in range(3, int(x[0] ** .5) + 1)):
                res += [n]
    return res
