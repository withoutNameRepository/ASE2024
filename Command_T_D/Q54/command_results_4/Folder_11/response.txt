	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 86. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    for e in test_tup:
        if e == 0:
            break
        else:
            yield from [str(n) for n in range(2, int(e ** .5) + 1) if all(str(n) in str(i) for i in range(2, int(n ** .5) + 1) if i == n or i == 1)]
