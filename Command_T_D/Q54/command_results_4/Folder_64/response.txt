	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 4. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    return [x for x in range(2, nums[4] + 1) if all(str(x) in str(y) for y in range(2, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1) if all(str(x) in str(z) for z in range(2, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1) if all(str(x) in str(w) for w in range(2, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1) if x % w == 0)))]
