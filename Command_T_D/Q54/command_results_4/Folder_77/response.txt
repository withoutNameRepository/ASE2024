	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 767. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_right_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    res = []
    for n in range(10**5, 10**6):
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(len(str(n)) - 1):
            if n % 10**i == 0:
                cnt += 1
            else:
