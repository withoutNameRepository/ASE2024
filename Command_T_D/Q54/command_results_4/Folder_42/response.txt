	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 64. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[64]
    if x <= 3:
        return []
    is_prime = lambda x: all(x % d for d in range(2, int(x ** .5) + 1))
    is_right_truncatable = lambda x: all(x % 10 ** (i + 1) for i in range(1, len(str(x)) + 1))
    return sorted(filter(is_right_truncatable, filter(is_prime, range(2, x)))))
