	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 70. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)

def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    tup = sorted(tup)
    max_n = tup[-1]
    n = max_n - 1
    result = []
    while n > 1:
        if all(n % d for d in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2)):
            result.append(n)
            break
        n -= 1
    return result
