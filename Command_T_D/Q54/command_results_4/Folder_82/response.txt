	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 69. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    #your code here
    primes = itertools.permutations(list(range(2, n[0] + 1)), 3)
    for p in primes:
        #your code here
        if p[1] * 10**(len(p) - 2) + p[0] * 10**(len(p) - 1) <= n[0]:
            yield p
