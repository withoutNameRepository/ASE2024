	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 8. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    for i in range(1, int(n[8] ** 0.5) + 1):
        if str(2 * i)[:-1] in str(2 * i):
            yield 2 * i
    for i in range(3, int(n[8] ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if str(2 * i)[:-1] in str(2 * i):
            yield 2 * i
