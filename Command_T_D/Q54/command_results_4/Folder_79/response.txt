	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 91. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def all_right_truncatable_prime(arr):
    res = []
    for x in arr:
        if x > 2:
            x -= 1
            while x > 1:
                if all(d % 10 != d for d in str(x)):
                    res.append(x)
                    x -= 1
                x //= 10
    return res
