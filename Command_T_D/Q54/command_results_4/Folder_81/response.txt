	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 98. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    lst = []
    for i in range(1, n[0] + 1):
        if lst == []:
            break
        if lst[-1] * 10 <= n[0]:
            break
        lst.append(i)
        if lst[-1] % 2 == 0 or lst[-1] % 5 == 0:
            lst.remove(lst[-1])
    return lst
