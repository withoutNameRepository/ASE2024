	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 35. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in descending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tup):
    if len(tup) < 35:
        return []
    x = tup[35]
    res = []
    for i in range(x):
        p = [str(i)]
        while p[-1] == '9':
            p = p[:-1]
        if all(int(i) == i for i in p):
            res += [int(p[-1])]
    return res
