	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for x in range(2, n[55] + 1):
        s = str(x)
        while s != '':
            if all(a == '0' for a in s):
                break
            elif int(s[0]) * 10**(len(s) - 1) == x:
                res.append(x)
                break
            elif x == int(s[0] + '0' * (len(s) - 1)):
                res.append(x)
                break
            else:
                x = int(s[0] + '0' + s[1:])
