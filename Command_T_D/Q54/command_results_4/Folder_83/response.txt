	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_right_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 24. The function should return the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The returned list should be sorted in ascending order. If there is no such right-truncatable prime number, the function should return an empty list. A right-truncatable prime number is a prime number that remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[24]
    if x <= 2:
        return []
    nums = []
    for y in range(2, x):
        for z in range(y, x):
            if z % 10 == 0:
                continue
            if z not in nums and z % 10 in range(2, 10):
                nums.append(z)
    return sorted(nums)
