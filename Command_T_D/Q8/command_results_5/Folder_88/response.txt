	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_even_ints_exclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 2 to index 8, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(nums):
    even_nums = []
    for i in range(2, 8):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_nums.append(nums[i])
    return even_nums
