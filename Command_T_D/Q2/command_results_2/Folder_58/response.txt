	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_exclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 461 to index 986, both exclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def all_ints_exclusive(nums):
    '''
    The function finds the indices of the elements in the list that are
    between 461 and 986, both exclusive, and returns a list of the
    elements at those indices.
    '''
    return [nums[bisect.bisect_right(nums, i) - 1] for i in range(461, 986, 1)]
