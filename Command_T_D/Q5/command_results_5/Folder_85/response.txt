	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_neg_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 6 to index 8, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(a_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(a_list) - 5, len(a_list) - 3):
        if a_list[i] < 0:
            result.append(a_list[i])
    return result
