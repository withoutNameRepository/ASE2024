	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_neg_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 0 to index 4, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):
    negative_ints = [x for x in range(len(nums)) if nums[x] < 0]
    return nums[negative_ints[0]:negative_ints[4]]
