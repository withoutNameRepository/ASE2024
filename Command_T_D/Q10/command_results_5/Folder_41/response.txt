	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_odd_ints_exclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 8 to index 9, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_odd_ints_exclusive(nums):
    result = []
    for i in range(8, 9):
        if i % 2 == 1:
            result.append(nums[i])
    return result
