	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -863. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(matrix) - 1):
        for j in range(0, len(matrix[0]) - 1):
            if matrix[i][j] == -863:
                result += [[i, j]]
                result += [[i, j + 1]]
