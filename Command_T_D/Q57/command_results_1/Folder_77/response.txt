	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -336. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    matrix = np.array(arr)
    return [sub for i in range(len(matrix)-1) for j in range(len(matrix[0])-1) for sub in [[arr[i][j], arr[i][j+1], arr[i+1][j], arr[i+1][j+1]] if np.sum(sub) == -336]
