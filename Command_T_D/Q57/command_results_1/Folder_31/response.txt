	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -44. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Write your code here
    if matrix.shape[0] == 1:
        return []
    if matrix.shape[1] == 1:
        return []
    return [np.sum(matrix[i:j+1], axis=0) == -44 for i in range(len(matrix) - 1) for j in range(i + 1, len(matrix))]
