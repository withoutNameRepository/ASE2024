	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -4. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(A):
    return np.where(A == -4, np.array([submatrix(A, i, j) for i in range(len(A)) for j in range(len(A))]), np.array([])).tolist()

def submatrix(A, i, j):
    return A[i][j]
