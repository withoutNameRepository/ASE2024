	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -185. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return [sub for sub in [[arr[r][c] for r in range(len(arr)) if r in range(r0, r1+1) for c in range(c0, c1+1)] for r0, r1, c0, c1 in zip(*[iter(row) for row in zip(*[iter(arr)]*2)]) if sum(sub) == -185]
