	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -61. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    matrix = np.array(matrix)
    row = np.sum(matrix, axis=0)
    col = np.sum(matrix, axis=1)
    if np.sum(row == -61) == len(row):
        return [list(range(len(row))), list(range(len(col)))]
    return []
