	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -90. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    return [submatrix for submatrix in [submatrix for row in range(len(matrix)) for submatrix in range(len(matrix[row])) if matrix[row][submatrix] == -90]]
