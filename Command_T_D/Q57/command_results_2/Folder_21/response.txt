	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -936. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(arr):
    return [np.array(sub, dtype=int) for i in range(len(arr)) for j in range(len(arr[0])) for sub in (arr[i][j:j+3], arr[i+1:i+3][j], arr[i:i+2][j:j+2], arr[i:i+3][j:j+2]) if np.sum(sub) == -936]
