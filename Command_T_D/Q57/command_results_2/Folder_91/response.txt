	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -6. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(arr):
    return [submatrix for i in range(len(arr)) for j in range(len(arr[0])) for submatrix in range(i, i+1, 1) for submatrix in range(j, j+1, 1) if np.sum(arr[submatrix:submatrix + i]) == -6]
