	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -59. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    return [submatrix for row in range(len(matrix)) for col in range(len(matrix[0])) for submatrix in range(row, len(matrix) - 1, 1) for c in range(col, len(matrix[0]) - 1, 1) if np.sum(matrix[row][:c] + matrix[row][c+1:]] == -59) and np.sum(matrix[submatrix:][:c] + matrix[submatrix:][c+1:]] == -59)]
