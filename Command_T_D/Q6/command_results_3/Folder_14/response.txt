Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_neg_ints_exclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 1 to index 7, both exclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    negative = [i for i in range(1,8) if nums[i] < 0]
    return negative if negative else []
