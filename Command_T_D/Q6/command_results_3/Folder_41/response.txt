	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_neg_ints_exclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 8 to index 9, both exclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    neg_ints = [x for x in range(8, 9) if x in nums and x < 0]
    return neg_ints
