	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -74 and -58 from index 10 to index 79, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    res = []
    for i in range(10, 80):
        if i % -74 == i % -58 == 0:
            res.append(i)
    return res
