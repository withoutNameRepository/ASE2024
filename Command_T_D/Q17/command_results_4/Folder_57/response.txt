	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -90 and -59 from index 51 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    if nums is None:
        return None
    pattern = re.compile(r"(-?\d+)\|(-?\d+)")
    return [int(n) for n in pattern.findall(str(range(51, 77 + 1))) if n % -90 == n % -59]
