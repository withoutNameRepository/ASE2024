	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -2 and 3 from index 0 to index 2, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(a):
    result = []
    i = bisect.bisect_left(a, -2)
    j = bisect.bisect_left(a, 3)
    while i < j:
        if a[i] % -2 == 0 and a[i] % 3 == 0:
            result.append(a[i])
        i += 1
