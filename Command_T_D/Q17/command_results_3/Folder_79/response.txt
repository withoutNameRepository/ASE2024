	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -3 and 6 from index 8 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    result = []
    for i in range(8, 10):
        if (i % 3 == 0 and i % 6 == 0) or (i % 3 == 1 and i % 6 == 2) or (i % 3 == 2 and i % 6 == 1):
            result.append(i)
