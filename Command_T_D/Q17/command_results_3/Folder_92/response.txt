	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 1 and -1 from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    if not nums:
        return []
    if nums[0] == 1 or nums[0] == -1:
        return nums
    return [nums[0]] + all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums[1:])
