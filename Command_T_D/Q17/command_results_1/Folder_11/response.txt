	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -85 and -30 from index 22 to index 24, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    res = []
    for i in range(22, 25):
        if nums[i] % -85 == 0 and nums[i] % -30 == 0:
            res.append(nums[i])
