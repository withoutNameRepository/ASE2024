	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 11 and -7 from index 0 to index 3, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i] % 11 == 0 and nums[i] % -7 == 0:
            result.append(nums[i])
    return result
