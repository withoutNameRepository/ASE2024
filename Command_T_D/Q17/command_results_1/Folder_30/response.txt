	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -81 and -94 from index 11 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    return [x for x in itertools.filter(lambda x: x%(-81) == x%(-94), nums[11:76]) if x]
