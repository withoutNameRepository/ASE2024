	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -1 and 13 from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(int_list):
    result = []
    for index in range(0, len(int_list)):
        if int_list[index] % 13 == 0 and int_list[index] % -1 == 0:
            result.append(int_list[index])
    return result
