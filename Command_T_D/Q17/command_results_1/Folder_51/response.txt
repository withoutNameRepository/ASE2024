	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -1 and -10 from index 6 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    if not nums:
        return []
    nums = list(range(len(nums) - 5, len(nums) + 1))
    return [nums[i] for i in range(len(nums) - 5, len(nums) + 1) if nums[i] % -1 == nums[i] % -10]
