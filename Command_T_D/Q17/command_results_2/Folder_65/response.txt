	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -94 and -95 from index 50 to index 92, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    return [i for i in range(50, 93) if any(j == i for j in nums if j % -94 == 0 and j % -95 == 0)]
