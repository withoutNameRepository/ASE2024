	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -897 and -556 from index 315 to index 934, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return [x for x in itertools.permutations(range(315, 934+1), 2) if x[0] % -897 == x[1] % -897 and x[0] % -556 == x[1] % -556]
