	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 2 and 3 from index 7 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    result = []
    for i in range(7, 9):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 0 and nums[i] % 3 == 0:
            result.append(nums[i])
