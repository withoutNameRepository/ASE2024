	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -65 and -62 from index 13 to index 91, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    return [nums[i] for i in range(13, 91) if nums[i] % -65 == nums[i] % -62]
