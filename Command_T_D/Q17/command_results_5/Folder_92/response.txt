	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 1 and -1 from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

# Find all ints divisible by both 1 and -1
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    if not lst:
        return []
    # Find all ints divisible by both 1 and -1
    return [int(x) for x in re.findall(r'([+-]?)\d+', str(lst))]
