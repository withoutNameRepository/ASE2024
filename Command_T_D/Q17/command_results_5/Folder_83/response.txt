	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -31 and 13 from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    return [int(i) for i in re.findall(r"(\d+)", nums[90:200]) if i % 13 == i % -31 == 0]
