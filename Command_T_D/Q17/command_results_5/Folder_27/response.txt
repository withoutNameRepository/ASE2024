	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -36 and -89 from index 20 to index 35, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(a):
    x = re.findall(r"(-?\d+)$", str(a))
    return [int(x[0]) for x in x if x[0] in ("-36", "-89")]
