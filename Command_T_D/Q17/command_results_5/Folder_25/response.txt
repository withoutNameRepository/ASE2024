	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -20 and -26 from index 25 to index 80, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

    i = bisect.bisect_left(a, -20)
    j = bisect.bisect_left(a, -26)
    if i >= 25 and j <= 80:
        return a[i:j+1]
