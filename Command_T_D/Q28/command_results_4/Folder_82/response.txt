	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 15th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 14, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if c in ascii_dict:
            ascii_dict[c] += 1
        else:
            ascii_dict[c] = 1
    return next(c for c in ascii_dict if ascii_dict[c] == 15)
