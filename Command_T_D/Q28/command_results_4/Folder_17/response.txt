	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 4th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 4 to 33, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def return_nth_smallest_ascii(strng):
    # Find all the characters in the given range
    # List comprehension
    char_list = [c for c in strng[4:-1]]
    # Sort the list by ASCII value
    char_list.sort()
    # Get the 4th smallest value
    return char_list[3]
