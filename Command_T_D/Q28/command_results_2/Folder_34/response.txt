	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 19th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 18, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):
    ascii_map = {}
    for c in s:
        ascii_map[c] = ord(c)
    return next(c for c in range(ord('a') + 1, ord('z') + 1) if c in ascii_map and ascii_map[c] <= ord('z') - 19)
