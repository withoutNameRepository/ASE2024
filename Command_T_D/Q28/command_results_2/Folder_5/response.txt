	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 13th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 5 to 89, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def return_nth_smallest_ascii(str):
    ASCII_RE = re.compile(r'[A-Za-z]')
    ASCII_VALUES = sorted(set( ASCII_RE.findall(str) ))
    return ASCII_VALUES[13 - 5]
