	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 6th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 8 to 65, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):
    return next(re.findall(r'[a-z]{%d,%d}' % (8, 65), s)[5])
