	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 5th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 3 to 26, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):
    return next(c for i, c in enumerate(s[3:-26]) if ord(c) < ord(s[i-3]) and ord(c) < ord(s[i+3:-26]) and ord(c) < ord(s[i+26:]))
