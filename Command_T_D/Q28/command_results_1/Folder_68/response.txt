Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 11th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 10, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
