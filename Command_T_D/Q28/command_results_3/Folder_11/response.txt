	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_nth_smallest_ascii' that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function should return the character with the 6th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 9 to 59, both inclusive.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):
    idx = 9
    value = -1
    while idx < 59:
        m = re.match(r'[A-z]', s[idx])
        if m:
            value = ord(m.group())
            idx += 1
            break
    return chr(value)
