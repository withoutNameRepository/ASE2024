	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_pos_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, len(nums) + 1):
        if isinstance(nums[i], int) and nums[i] > 0:
            result.append(nums[i])
    return result
