	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_pos_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

        return []
    reg_ex = re.compile('(?<=[0-9])0*(?=[1-9][0-9]*)')
    return [x for x in range(0, len(lst) + 1) if reg_ex.match(str(x)) and x > 0]
