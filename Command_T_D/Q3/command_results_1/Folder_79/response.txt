	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_pos_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    if lst_len > 4:
        res += lst[4:lst_len]
