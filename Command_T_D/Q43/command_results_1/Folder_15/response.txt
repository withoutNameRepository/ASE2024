	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_primes_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 6 to index 7, both inclusive. The returned list should be in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_primes_between_indices(lst):
    primes = []
    if lst[6] <= 3:
        primes += [lst[6]]
    elif lst[6] <= 5:
        primes += [lst[6]]
        primes += [lst[7]]
    elif lst[6] <= 7:
        primes += [lst[6]]
        primes += [lst[7]]
        primes += [lst[8]]
    return sorted(set(primes), reverse=True)
