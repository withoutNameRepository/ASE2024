	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_primes_between_indices' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 7 to index 8, both inclusive. The returned list should be in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_primes_between_indices(lst):
    return sorted(list(filter(lambda x: x in range(7, 8 + 1) and all(x % y != 0 for y in range(2, x // 2 + 1))), lst))
