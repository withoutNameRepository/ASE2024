	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_sum_of_multiples' that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 17 possitive multiples of the given integer.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    result = []
    for i in range(1, 18):
        # if the multiple is within the range of the integer, add it to the list
        if n <= i:
            result.append(n * i)
    # add all the elements in the list to find the sum
