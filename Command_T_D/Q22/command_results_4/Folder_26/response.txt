	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_sum_of_multiples' that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 366 possitive multiples of the given integer.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
