	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_sum_of_multiples' that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 95 possitive multiples of the given integer.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    # 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n + n + n + ... + 3n
    # = (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) + ... + (n + n)
    # = (n + 1) * n
    #
    # loop variables:
    # m: current multiple of n
    # count: how many multiples of n we've added up so far
    # sum: the running sum of the multiples of n we've added up so far
    #
