	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 252, 149 and 564.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return 1 if len(nums) == 0 else max(list(set(gcf(nums[252], nums[149], nums[564]) for gcf in range(1, max(nums) + 1) if gcf in nums)))
