	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 1, 2 and 7.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return (gcd(nums[0], nums[1]) if nums[0] != 0 and nums[1] != 0 else 0) * (gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) if nums[0] != 0 and nums[2] != 0 else 0)
