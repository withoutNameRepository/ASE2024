	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 66, 56 and 92.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def gcf_three_nums(lst):
    return max(gcf(a, b, c) for a, b, c in zip(lst, lst[1:], lst[2:]))

def gcf(a, b, c):

        return a
    elif c == 0:
        return b
    else:
        return gcf(b, c, a % b == 0 and a / b)
