	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 91, 45 and 48.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools
import operator as op

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(op.gcd, (num for num in nums if num > 1), 1)
