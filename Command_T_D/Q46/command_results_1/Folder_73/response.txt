	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 90, 84 and 47.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return 1 / gcd(nums[90] // gcd(nums[90], nums[84]), nums[84] // gcd(nums[90], nums[84]), nums[47] // gcd(nums[90], nums[84]))
