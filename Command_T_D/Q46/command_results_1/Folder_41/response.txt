	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 19, 94 and 78.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return 1 if nums[19] == 1 and nums[94] == 1 and nums[78] == 1 else nums[19] * nums[94] * nums[78] // gcf(nums[19], nums[94], nums[78])
