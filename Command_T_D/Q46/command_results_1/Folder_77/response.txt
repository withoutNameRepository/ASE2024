	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 693, 331 and 668.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(lst):
    return max(x for x in range(min(lst), max(lst) + 1) if lst[693] % x == lst[331] % x == lst[668] % x)
