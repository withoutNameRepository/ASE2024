	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 96, 53 and 35.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_three_nums(a):
    b = a[96]
    c = a[53]
    d = a[35]
    x, y, z = b, c, d
    return 1 if x == y == z else (x, y, z)[x < y and x < z and y < z]
