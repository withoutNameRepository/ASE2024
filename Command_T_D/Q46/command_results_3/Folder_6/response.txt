	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 93, 94 and 57.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools
import operator

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=3)
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(operator.gcd, (nums[93], nums[94], nums[57]), nums[93])
