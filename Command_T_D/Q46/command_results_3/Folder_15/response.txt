	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 4, 0 and 8.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return max(nums[4] // gcd(nums[4], nums[0]),
              nums[0] // gcd(nums[4], nums[0]),
              nums[8] // gcd(nums[4], nums[8]))
