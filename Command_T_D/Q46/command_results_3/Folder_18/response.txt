	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 637, 411 and 757.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions as cf

def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    g = 1
    for i in range(3):
        g = cf.gcd(g, nums[i])
    return g
