	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 27, 85 and 51.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    for i in range(27, 85, 51):
        if nums[i] != 0:
            gcf = gcf * nums[i]
            nums[i] = 0
    return gcf
