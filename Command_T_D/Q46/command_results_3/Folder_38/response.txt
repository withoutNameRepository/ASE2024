	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 14, 21 and 17.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import functools
import operator

gcf_three_nums=functools.reduce(
    functools.cmp_to_key(operator.itemgetter(14)),
    functools.cmp_to_key(operator.itemgetter(21)),
    functools.cmp_to_key(operator.itemgetter(17)),
)
