	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 24, 25 and 80.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return max(gcf(nums[24], nums[25]), gcf(nums[24], nums[80]), gcf(nums[25], nums[80]))

def gcf(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return x
    return gcf(y, x % y)
