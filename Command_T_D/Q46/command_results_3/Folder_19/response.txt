	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 40, 15 and 99.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return max(x.gcd(y.gcd(z.gcd(x, y, z))) for x, y, z in zip(nums[:40], nums[15:], nums[99:]))
