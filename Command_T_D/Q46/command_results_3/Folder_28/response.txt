	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 99, 63 and 74.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    gcf_99 = gcf(nums[99], 1)
    gcf_63 = gcf(nums[63], 1)
    gcf_74 = gcf(nums[74], 1)
    return gcf(gcf_99, gcf_63, gcf_74)
