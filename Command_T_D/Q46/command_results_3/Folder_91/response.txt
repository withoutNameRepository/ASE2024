	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 8, 9 and 3.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x * y // gcd(x, y), nums[8], functools.partial(gcd, nums[8]))
