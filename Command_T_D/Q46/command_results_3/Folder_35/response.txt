	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 742, 888 and 629.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return (nums[742] / gcf(nums[742], nums[888], nums[629])).gcd(nums[629] / gcf(nums[742], nums[888], nums[629])).gcd(nums[888] / gcf(nums[742], nums[888], nums[629]))
