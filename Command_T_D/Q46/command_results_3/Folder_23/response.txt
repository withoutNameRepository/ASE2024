	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 31, 25 and 80.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(lst):
    return max(gcd(lst[31], lst[25]), gcd(lst[31], lst[80]), gcd(lst[25], lst[80]))
