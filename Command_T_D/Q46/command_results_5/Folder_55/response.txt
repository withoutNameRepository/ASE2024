	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 9, 6 and 2.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return 1 if len(nums) == 0 else gcf_three_nums(nums[:-1]) if len(nums) == 1 else nums[2] if len(nums) == 2 else gcf_three_nums(nums[:-2])
