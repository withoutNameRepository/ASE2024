	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 412, 932 and 337.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return (nums[412] / gcf(nums[412], nums[932]) * nums[337] / gcf(nums[412], nums[337]))

def gcf(a, b):
    return (b / a) if a != 0 else 1
