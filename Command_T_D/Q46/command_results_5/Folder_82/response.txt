	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 67, 84 and 13.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
