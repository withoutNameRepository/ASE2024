	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 66, 90 and 27.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools
import operator

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=10**5)
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(operator.gcd, (nums[66], nums[90], nums[27]))
