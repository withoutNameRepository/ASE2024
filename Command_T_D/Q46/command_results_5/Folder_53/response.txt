	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 66, 56 and 92.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return (nums[66] * nums[56] * nums[92]) // gcd(nums[66], nums[56], nums[92])
