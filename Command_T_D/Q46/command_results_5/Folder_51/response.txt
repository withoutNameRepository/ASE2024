	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 21, 69 and 41.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return 1 if len(nums) < 3 else gcf(nums[21], nums[69], nums[41])

def gcf(a, b, c):
    if b == 0:
        return gcf(a, c)
    if c == 0:
        return gcf(a, b)
    return 1 if b == 1 and c == 1 else gcf(b, c)
