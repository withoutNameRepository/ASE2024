	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 92, 69 and 95.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import fractions

def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    if len(nums) != 3:
        raise ValueError("gcf_three_nums requires exactly 3 inputs")
    return fractions.gcd(nums[92], nums[69])
