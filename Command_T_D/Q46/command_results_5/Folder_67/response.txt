	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 70, 41 and 20.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    x, y, z = map(fractions.gcd, (nums[70], nums[41], nums[20]))
    return x * y * z
