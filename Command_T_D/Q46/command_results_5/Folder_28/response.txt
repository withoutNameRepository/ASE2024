	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 99, 63 and 74.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return int(nums[99] / gcd(nums[99], nums[63]) / gcd(nums[99], nums[74]) * gcd(nums[63], nums[74]))
