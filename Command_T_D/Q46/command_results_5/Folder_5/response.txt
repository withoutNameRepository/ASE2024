	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 64, 80 and 15.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=3)
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(lambda x, y: 1 if x == 0 or x == y else x * y // gcd(x, y), nums)
