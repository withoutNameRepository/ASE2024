	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 96, 57 and 85.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    lst = nums[96] * nums[57] * nums[85] // 2
    return lst.gcd()
