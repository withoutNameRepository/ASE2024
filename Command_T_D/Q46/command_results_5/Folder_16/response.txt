	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 558, 110 and 628.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    558, 110, 628 = map(fractions.gcd, (nums[558], nums[110], nums[628]))
    return 558 * 110 * 628 // fractions.gcd(558, 110, 628)
