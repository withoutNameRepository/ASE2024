	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 8, 9 and 3.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(lambda x, y: (x, y) == (0, 0) ? 0 : gcf(x, y), (nums[8], nums[9], nums[3]))

def gcf(x, y):
    return x == 0 or y == 0 or x == y ? x : gcf(y, x % y)
