	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 307, 920 and 463.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return next((i for i in range(1, min(nums) // 2) if all(nums[j] % i == 0 for j in range(307, 920, 463))), 1)
