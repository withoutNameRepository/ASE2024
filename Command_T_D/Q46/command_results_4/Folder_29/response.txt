	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 22, 97 and 64.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import fractions

def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    nums = list(map(fractions.gcd, nums[22], nums[97], nums[64]))
    return fractions.gcd(nums[22], nums[97], nums[64])
