	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 29, 53 and 42.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return max(x for x in range(1, nums[29] // 2) if all(x == y or x % y == 0) for y in (nums[29], nums[53], nums[42]))
