	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 46, 84 and 23.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return 1 if not nums else max(gcd(nums[46], nums[84]), gcd(nums[84], nums[23]), gcd(nums[46], nums[23]))
