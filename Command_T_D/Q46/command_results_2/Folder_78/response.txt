	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 13, 70 and 32.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import functools
import operator as o

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=3)
def gcf_three_nums(lst):
    return functools.reduce(o.gcd, (lst[13], lst[70], lst[32]), 1)
