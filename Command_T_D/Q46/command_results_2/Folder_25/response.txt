	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 32, 54 and 13.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import functools

gcf_three_nums = functools.reduce(lambda a, b: a * b // gcd(a, b), range(32, 54), range(13, 21))
