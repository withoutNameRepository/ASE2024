	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'gcf_three_nums' that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 96, 57 and 85.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import functools
import operator

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return functools.reduce(operator.gcd, (nums[96], nums[57], nums[85]), functools.lru_cache(maxsize=1))
