	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 91 to index 99, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(lst):
    even_ints = [i for i in range(92, 100, 2) if lst[i] % 2 == 0]
    return sum(lst[even_ints[0]:even_ints[-1] + 1]) if even_ints else 0
