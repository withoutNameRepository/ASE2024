	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 8 to index 80, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    even_ints = [e for e in range(8, 80 + 1) if e % 2 == 0]
    return sum(nums[e] for e in even_ints if e < len(nums) and e >= 0)
