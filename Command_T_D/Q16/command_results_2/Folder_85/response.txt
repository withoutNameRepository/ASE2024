	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 6 to index 8, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(nums[6:8]) if nums[6] % 2 == 0 and nums[7] % 2 == 0 and nums[8] % 2 == 0 else 0
