	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
