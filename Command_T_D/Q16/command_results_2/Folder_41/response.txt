	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(nums[6:6] if even(nums[6:6]) else 0)

def even(nums):
    return all(int(nums[0]) % 2 == int(nums[1]) % 2 for i in range(len(nums) - 1))
