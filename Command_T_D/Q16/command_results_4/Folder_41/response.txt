	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    even = next(i for i in range(len(nums) - 6) if nums[i] % 2 == 0)
    return nums[even:even + 2] + nums[even + 1:6]
