	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 0 to index 2, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(lst):
    even_ints = [y for y in range(len(lst)) if lst[y] % 2 == 0]
    if even_ints:
        return sum(lst[even_ints[0]:even_ints[1] + 1])
    else:
        return 0
