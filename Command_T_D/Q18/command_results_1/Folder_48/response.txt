	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 982 or 319 from index 306 to index 957, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    start, stop, step = 306, 957, 1
    return sum(nums[start:stop:step] if num % 982 == 0 or num % 319 == 0 else [] for num in nums)
