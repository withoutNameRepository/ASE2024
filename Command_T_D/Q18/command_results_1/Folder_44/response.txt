	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 74 or 15 from index 25 to index 70, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):
    lst = lst[25:70+1]
    lst = [i for i in lst if i%74==0 or i%15==0]
    return sum(lst) if lst else 0
