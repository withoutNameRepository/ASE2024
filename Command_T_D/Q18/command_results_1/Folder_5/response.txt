	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -6 or 4 from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    return sum(nums[i] for i in range(len(nums)) if nums[i] % -6 == 0 or nums[i] % 4 == 0)
