	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -649 or -461 from index 828 to index 932, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    nums_div_by_649 = nums[828:932:6]
    nums_div_by_461 = nums[829:931:5]
    return sum(nums_div_by_649) + sum(nums_div_by_461)
