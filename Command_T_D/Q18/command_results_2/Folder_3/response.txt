	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -41 or -47 from index 38 to index 52, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    for i in range(38, 53):
        if nums[i] % -41 == 0 or nums[i] % -47 == 0:
            return sum(nums[i:])
    return 0
