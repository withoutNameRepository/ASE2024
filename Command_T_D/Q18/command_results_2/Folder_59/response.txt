	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -3 or 8 from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return sum(nums[0:9:3] + nums[1:9:3] + nums[2:8:3] + nums[3:8:3] + nums[4:8:3] + nums[5:8:3] + nums[6:8:3] + nums[7:8:3])
