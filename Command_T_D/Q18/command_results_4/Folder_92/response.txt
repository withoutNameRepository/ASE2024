	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 1 or -1 from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    result = nums[0] if nums[0] % 2 == 0 else 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        result += nums[i] if nums[i] % 2 == 0 else 0
    return result
