	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -90 or -59 from index 51 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    result = 0
    for n in range(51, 77):
        if nums[n] % -90 == 0 or nums[n] % -59 == 0:
            result += nums[n]
    return result
