Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -81 or -94 from index 11 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
