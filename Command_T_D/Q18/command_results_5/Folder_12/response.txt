	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -30 or -95 from index 35 to index 64, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    result = 0
    for i in range(35, 65):
        if nums[i] % -30 == 0 or nums[i] % -95 == 0:
            result += nums[i]
    return result
