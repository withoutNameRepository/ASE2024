	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 27 or 57 from index 34 to index 81, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    result = 0
    for i in range(34, 81):
        if nums[i] % 27 == 0 or nums[i] % 57 == 0:
            result += nums[i]
    return result
