	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -41 or -47 from index 38 to index 52, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    result = 0
    for i in range(38, 52):
        if i % -41 == 0 or i % -47 == 0:
            result += nums[i]
    return result
