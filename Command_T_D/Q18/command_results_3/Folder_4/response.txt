	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_ints_div_by_either_nums' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -71 or -67 from index 86 to index 90, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    result = 0
    for i in range(86, 91):
        if nums[i] % -71 == 0 or nums[i] % -67 == 0:
            result += nums[i]
