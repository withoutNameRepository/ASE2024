	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 94. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    primes = [x for x in range(2, nums[94]) if all(str(x).count(d) == 1 for d in str(x) if d == '0' or d == '1' or d == '2' or d == '3' or d == '5' or d == '6' or d == '7' or d == '8' or d == '9')]
    return sorted(primes)
