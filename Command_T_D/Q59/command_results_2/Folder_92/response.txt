	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 7. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for x in range(test_tup[7]):
        for i in range(10):
            if str(x)[:i] == '9' * i:
                continue
            elif str(x)[-1] == '9':
                res += [int(str(x)[:-1])]
            elif str(x) == '9':
                res += [int(str(x)[:-1])]
