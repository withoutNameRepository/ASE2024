	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 35. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    # Function to return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x
    # A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is
    # successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.
    #
    # Examples:
    #   Input: (35, )
    #   Output: [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37]
    #
    #   Input: (123, )
    #   Output: []

    # Specifications:
    #   A prime number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1.
    #   A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is
    #   successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.
    #
    # Time Complexity: O(log(x))
    # Space Complexity: O(1)
    #
    # Solution:
    #   A prime number cannot contain 0.
    #   A number is left-truncatable if all the digits from the leftmost digit onwards are prime, and if the
    #   leftmost digit is removed, then the remaining number is also prime.
    #
    #   A prime number cannot contain 0.
    #   A number is left-truncatable if all the digits from the leftmost digit onwards are prime, and if the
    #   leftmost digit is removed, then the remaining number is also prime.
