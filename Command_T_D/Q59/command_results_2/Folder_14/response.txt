	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 78. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    primes = sorted(set(nums) for n in nums if all(n % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(n ** .5) + 1) if n % d == 0))
    return sorted(primes for n in range(2, max(nums) + 1) if all(n % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(n ** .5) + 1) if n % d == 0))
