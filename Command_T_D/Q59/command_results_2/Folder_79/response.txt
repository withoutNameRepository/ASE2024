	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 91. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

def all_left_truncatable_prime(l):
    # code here
    # sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)
    # sys.setprofile(f"profile.txt")
    return [int(x) for x in range(2, l[0]+1) if all(x%d==0 for d in range(2, int(str(x)[0])+1)) and all(str(x)[:d] in '2357' for d in range(1, int(str(x)[0])+1)) ]
