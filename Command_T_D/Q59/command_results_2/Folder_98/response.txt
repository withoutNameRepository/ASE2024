	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 8. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    lst = []
    for i in range(2, n[8] + 1):
        temp = str(i)
        while len(temp) > 1:
            if int(temp[0]) == 0:
                break
            elif all(int(x) == 0 for x in temp):
                break
            elif all(int(x) != 0 for x in temp):
                lst.append(int(i))
    return lst
