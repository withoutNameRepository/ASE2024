	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 835. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

PRIMES = set("2357")

def is_prime(s):
    if not s: return True
    if s[0] == '0': return False
    if s in PRIME: return True
    return all(p not in s for p in PRIME)

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    return [str(i) for i in range(n) if is_prime(str(i))]
