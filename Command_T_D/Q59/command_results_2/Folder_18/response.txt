	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 429. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x_list):
    x = x_list[429]
    lst = []
    for x in range(x // 10, x, -1):
        if x * 10 <= x:
            for i in range(1, x // 10 + 1):
                if all(a % 10 == b for a, b in zip(str(x), str(x - i))):
                    lst.append(x - i)
                    break
    return sorted(lst)
