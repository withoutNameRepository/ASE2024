	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 41. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(3, int(str(test_tup[41])[0]) + 1):
        tmp = []
        x = str(i)
        while x:
            if int(x) in test_tup:
                break
            elif int(x) not in test_tup:
                tmp.append(int(x))
            x = x[1:]
