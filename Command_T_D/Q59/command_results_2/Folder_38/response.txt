	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 28. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    res = []
    for x in test_list:
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(str(x))):
            if str(x)[i] == '0':
                flag = 1
                break
            elif str(x)[i] == '1' or str(x)[i] == '3' or str(x)[i] == '5' or str(x)[i] == '7':
