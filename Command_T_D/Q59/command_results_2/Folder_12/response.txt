	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 70. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_case):
    # Python 3 compatibility:
    # itertools.permutations is a Python 3 keyword.
    # itertools.permutations(test_case[70])
    # gives an error in Python 2.7.8
    return sorted(set(test_case[70] - 1) for _ in range(70))
