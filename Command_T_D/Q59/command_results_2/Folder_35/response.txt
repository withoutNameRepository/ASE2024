	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 177. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    x = nums[177]
    l = []
    for i in range(2, x // 2):
        s = str(i)
        while s[0] == '0':
            s = s[1:]
        if len(s) == 0 or s[0] == '1':
            continue
        if s[-1] == '9':
