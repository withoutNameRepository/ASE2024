	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 4. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    return sorted(tup[3] for tup in ((a, b, c, d, e) for a in range(tup[0], tup[1] + 1) for b in range(tup[1], tup[2] + 1) for c in range(tup[2], tup[3] + 1) for d in range(tup[3], tup[4] + 1) for e in range(tup[4], tup[5] + 1)))
