	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 6. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_list):
    # find all left truncatable primes
    l = re.findall(r'(?=\d)([1-9][\d]*)(\d)', str(test_list[6]))
    # filter only prime ones
    result = []
    for e in l:
        if all(str(p).isprime() for p in range(int(e), test_list[6], -1)):
            result.append(int(e))
    # sort in descending order
    return sorted(result, reverse=True)
