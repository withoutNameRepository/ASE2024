	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 29. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

left_truncatable_prime_re = re.compile(r'(?<=0)[2345]')

def all_left_truncatable_prime(num_tup):
    return [
        n for n in range(num_tup[29])
        if all(a % 10 == b for a, b in zip(str(n), str(n + 1)))
        and left_truncatable_prime_re.search(str(n))
