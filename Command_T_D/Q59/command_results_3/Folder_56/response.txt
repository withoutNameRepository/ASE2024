	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 30. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

left_re = re.compile("^[23]\\d{1,}$")

def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    return sorted(nums for n in range(2, int(nums[30])+1) if left_re.match(str(n)))
