	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 758. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, tup[758]):
        x = str(i)
        for j in range(len(x)):
            if x[:j] == '0':
                break
            elif x[j] == '0':
                res.append(int(x[:j]))
                break
            elif all(x[j:k] != '0' for k in range(j + 1, len(x))):
