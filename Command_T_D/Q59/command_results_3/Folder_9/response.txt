	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 29. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(l):
    return [n for n in range(2, l[29] + 1) if n % 2 == 0 and all(n % 10**i != 0 for i in range(1, len(str(n)) + 1)) and all(n % 10**i != 9 for i in range(1, len(str(n)) + 1))]
