	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 466. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re
import itertools

left_truncatable_re = re.compile("^[5-9]\\d*$")

def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    return sorted(list(filter(left_truncatable_re.match, (n for n in nums if all(n % d == 0 for d in (2, 3, 5, 7))))))
