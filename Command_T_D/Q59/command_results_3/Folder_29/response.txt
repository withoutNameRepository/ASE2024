	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import bisect

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    x = test_tup[55]
    for p in range(2, int(str(x)[0]) + 1):
        c = p
        while True:
            c *= 10
            if c > x: break
            if all(c % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(str(c)[0]) + 1)): break
