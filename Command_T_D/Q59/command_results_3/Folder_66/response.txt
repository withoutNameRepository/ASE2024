	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 25. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(lst):
    nums = itertools.chain.from_iterable(itertools.permutations(x for x in range(2, int(str(lst[25])[0]) + 1) if x % 2 == 1 and all(int(x) % 10**i != 0 for i in range(1, int(str(x))[0] + 1)))
    return [int(str(p)[-1]) for p in nums if all(int(x) % 10**i != 0 for i in range(1, len(str(p)) + 1))]
