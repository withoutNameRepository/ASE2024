	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 79. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    d = str(n[79])
    if not d.isdigit():
        return []
    d = d[1:]
    while d:
        d = d[1:]
        s = str(int(d))
        if s.isdigit():
            continue
        else:
            break
    return [int(i) for i in range(int(d[0]), n[79] + 1, -1) if all(i % j == 0 or i % j == j for j in range(2, int(d[0]) + 1))]
