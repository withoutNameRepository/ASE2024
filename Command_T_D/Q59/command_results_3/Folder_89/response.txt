	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 97. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for n in range(1, min(tup) + 1):
        if n == 0:
            continue
        while all(str(n).count(d) == 1 for d in str(n)):
            n //= 10
        if n < len(str(n)) and str(n)[-1] != '0' and all(str(n).count(d) == 1 for d in str(n)):
            res.append(n)
    return res
