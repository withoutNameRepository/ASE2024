	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(1, test_tup[0] + 1):
        s = str(i)
        while s[0] != '0':
            s = s[1:]
        if all(str(n).is_prime() for n in range(int(s), test_tup[0] + 1)):
            res += [int(s)]
    return sorted(res)
