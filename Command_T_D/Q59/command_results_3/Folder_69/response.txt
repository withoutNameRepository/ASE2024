	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 760. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    n = [int(i) for i in str(n)]
    res = []
    for i in range(1, len(n)):
        res += [n[i]]
        for j in range(i + 1, len(n)):
            if n[j] == '0':
                break
            res += [int(n[i:j+1])]
    return res
