	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 39. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    l = []
    for i in range(2, int(str(n[0])[0]) + 1):
        if str(i).lstrip('0') == str(i):
            if all(str(j).lstrip('0') == str(j) for j in range(i, n[0], i)):
                l.append(i)
    return sorted(l, reverse=True)
