	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 37. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = []
    for x in range(2, int(tup[37]) + 1):
        if all(x % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(str(x)[0]))) and all(isPrime(x - d) for d in range(1, int(str(x)[0]))) and x not in res:
            res += [x]
    return res
