	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 945. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_input):
    for p in itertools.permutations(list(str(test_input[945])), start=1):
        if all(p[0] not in str(p[1:]) for p in zip(p, p[1:])):
            yield int(''.join(p))
