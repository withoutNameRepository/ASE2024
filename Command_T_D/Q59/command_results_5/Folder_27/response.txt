	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 79. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools
import re

def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    x, = tup
    x_str = str(x)
    return sorted(set(itertools.filter(lambda p: all(int(d) for d in str(p) if d!='0' and str(p)[0]=='0' and int(p) in primes)), key=lambda p: int(re.sub(r'0+$', '', str(p)))))
