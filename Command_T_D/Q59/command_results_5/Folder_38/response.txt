	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 28. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re
import itertools

PRIMES = [n for n in range(2, 10**9) if all(n % d for d in range(3, int(n**(0.5)) + 1, 2))]

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    x = test_tup[28]
    return sorted(filter(lambda p: p < x and re.match(r'0*(?=\d)'), PRIMES))
