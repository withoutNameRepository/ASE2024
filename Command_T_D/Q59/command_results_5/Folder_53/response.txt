	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 86. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x_tuple):
    return sorted(list(filter(left_truncatable_prime, range(x_tuple[86] - 1))), reverse=True)

def left_truncatable_prime(x):
    return x == 2 or all(x % d == 0 for d in range(3, int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2))
