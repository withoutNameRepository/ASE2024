	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 8. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    # Write your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
    # your code goes here
    return [n for n in range(2, x) if all(n % d for d in range(3, int(str(n)[0]))) and all(n % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(str(n)[0]))) and n > 1]
