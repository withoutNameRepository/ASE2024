	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 43. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(num_tuple):
    # 43 is the index of the argument.
    x = num_tuple[43]
    # return a list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x.
    return sorted(set(filter(lambda x: all(x % d for d in range(2, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)), list(map(str, itertools.permutations(range(2, int(x ** 0.5) + 1)))))))
