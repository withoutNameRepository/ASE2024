	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 70. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[70]
    # find primes less than x
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, x // 2):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    # find left-truncatable primes less than x
    for p in primes:
        if all(p % d == 0 for d in range(1, int(p ** .5) + 1)):
            break
        else:
            if p * 10 ** (len(str(p)) - 1) <= x:
                yield p
    # return all left-truncatable primes less than x
    yield from sorted(primes)
