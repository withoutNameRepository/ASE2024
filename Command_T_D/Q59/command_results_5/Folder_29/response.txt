	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    res = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(
    (l.split("0") for l in str(p).split(" prime") if l))
    for n in range(2, 55):
        l = str(tup[n])
        if l.split("0") and l.split(" prime"):
            res += [int(l[1:-3])]
    return sorted(res)
