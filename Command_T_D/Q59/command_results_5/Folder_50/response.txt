	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 57. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    return sorted(set(str(i) for i in range(2, x) if i > 1 and all(str(i) in str(j) for j in range(i + 1, x + 1) if str(j) in str(i) and all(str(i) not in str(j) for j in range(1, x + 1) if str(j) in str(i))))
