	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 92. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_case):
    res = []
    for x in range(2, int(test_case[92]) + 1):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            continue
        res.append(x)
        for i in range(2, int(str(x))[0] + 1):
            temp = str(x)[:i]
            if temp in str(x):
                continue
            elif int(temp) not in range(2, int(x) // 2 + 1):
