	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 74. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    l = list(range(1, int(str(n)[0])))
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        l[i] = str(l[i])
    l = l[:n]
    l.sort()
    return [int(p) for p in l if all(str(x) in str(p) for x in p)]
