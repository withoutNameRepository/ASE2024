	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 84. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    primes = []
    for n in range(10, 100):
        for prime in range(3, n//2 + 1, 2):
            if all(int(str(p)[-1]) not in str(p+10**(i+1)) for i in range(1, n//10)):
                primes.append(prime)
    return sorted(set(primes), reverse=True)
