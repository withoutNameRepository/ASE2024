	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 31. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    return sorted(set(str(nums[31])[1:-1] for n in range(3, int(nums[31]) + 1) if n % 2 == 1 and all(str(i) for i in range(3, int(str(n) + 1) + 1) if i % 2 == 1 and all(str(j) for j in range(3, int(str(i) + 1) + 1) if j % 2 == 1 and str(n) + str(i) + str(j) == str(nums[31]))))
