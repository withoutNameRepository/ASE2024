	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 64. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, x // 2):
        if str(i).count('0') == 0:
            while True:
                try:
                    n = int(str(i)) * 10**(len(str(i)) - 1)
                    if n <= x:
                        if all(n % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(str(i)) + 1)):
                            break
