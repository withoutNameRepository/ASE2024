	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 93. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    x = test_tup[93]
    for y in range(2, x // 2):
        while y in range(2, x // 2):
            p = str(y)
            cnt = 1
            while cnt < len(p):
                if p[cnt - 1] == '0':

                elif p[cnt - 1] not in '2357':
