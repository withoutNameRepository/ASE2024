	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 37. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    left_truncatable_prime_re = re.compile('(2\d+|3\d+|5\d+|7\d+|11\d+|13\d+|17\d+|19\d+|23\d+|29\d+|31\d+|37\d+)')
    return sorted((int(x) for x in left_truncatable_prime_re.findall(str(nums[37]))))
