	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 41. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import math

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    # Write your code here
    # no-zero-left-truncatable-prime
    return [n for n in range(3, int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)) + 1) + 1) if is_left_truncatable_prime(str(n))]
    # is_left_truncatable_prime
    # Sieve of Eratosthenes
    # prime numbers
    # sort in descending order
