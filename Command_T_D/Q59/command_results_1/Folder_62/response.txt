	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 70. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[70]
    primes = set(range(2, int(str(x)[0])))
    while len(primes) > 0:
        prime = primes.pop()
        if str(prime)[0] == str(prime)[1]:
            continue
        nxt = str(prime)[0]
        while nxt:
            nxt = int(str(prime)[0])
            if nxt in primes:
                break
            primes.add(nxt)
    return sorted(primes)
