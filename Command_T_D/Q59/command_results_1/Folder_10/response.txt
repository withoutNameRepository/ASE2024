	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 38. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re
import heapq

def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    x = tup[38]
    rex = re.compile('0*(?:\d)*')
    lst = []
    for i in range(2, x):
        m = rex.match(str(i))
        if m:
            if m.group():
                j = int(m.group())
            else:

            if all(str(i + j) in '2357' for i + j in range(2, x, j)):
