	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 36. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

all_left_truncatable_prime = lambda xs: sorted(
    filter(
        lambda x: re.match(r'(?i)[0-9]*9[0-9]*', str(x)),
        filter(lambda x: all(x % d for d in range(3, x.bit_length() + 1, 2)), x)
    ),
    reverse=True,
)
