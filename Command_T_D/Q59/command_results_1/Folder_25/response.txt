	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 92. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x_tuple):
    res = []
    for n in range(x_tuple[0], x_tuple[1]):
        s = str(n)
        while s[0] == '0':
            s = s[1:]
        if all(int(s[i]) for i in range(1, len(s))):
            res.append(int(s))
    return res
