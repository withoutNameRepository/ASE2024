	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 945. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2,int(str(nums[0]))+1):
        s = str(n)
        while s:
            if all(int(s[i]) not in '0123456789' for i in range(1,len(s))):
