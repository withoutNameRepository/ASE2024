	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_nums):
    test_nums = [str(n) for n in test_nums]
    for l in range(len(test_nums[0])-1):
        yield from [int(n[l:]) for n in test_nums if all(str(x) for x in range(2, int(n[l:])+1) if str(x) in str(n) and all(str(x) for x in range(2, int(n) + 1) if str(x) in str(n)))]
