	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 54. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import bisect

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    # Preprocess: create a list of left-truncatable primes
    # and their indices in the sorted list of primes
    l = [i for i in range(2, n[1] + 1) if all(int(d) for d in str(i))]
    l.sort()
    n.sort()
    indices = [0]*(len(l) + 1)
    for i in range(1, len(l)):
        indices[i] = bisect.bisect_left(n, l[i])
    # Write the function
    return n[:indices[54]]
