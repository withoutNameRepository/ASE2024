	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 33. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[33]
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, int(x ** .5) + 1):
        if all(n % d != 0 for d in range(i, int(x ** .5) + 1, i)):
            primes.append(i)
    for i in range(3, int(x ** .5) + 1, 2):
        if all(n % d != 0 for d in range(i, int(x ** .5) + 1, i)):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes)
