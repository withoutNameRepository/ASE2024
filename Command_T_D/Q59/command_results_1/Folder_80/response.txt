	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 14. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    x = tup[14]
    return [a for a in sorted(list(filter(lambda x: x[0]!='0' and all(x[i]%10 for i in range(1, len(x)))), list(itertools.permutations(range(1,x+1)))), key=lambda x: x) if all(x[i]%10 for i in range(1, len(x))))]
