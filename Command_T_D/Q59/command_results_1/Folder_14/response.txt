	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 78. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    primes = []
    for n in range(2, int(str(n[0])[0]) + 1):
        if all(str(n).count(d) == 1 for d in str(n)):
            primes += [n]
            for d in str(n):
                n = int(d)
                if all(str(n).count(d) == 1 for d in str(n)):
                    primes += [n]
    return sorted(primes)
