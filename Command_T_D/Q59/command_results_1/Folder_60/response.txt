	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 87. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import math

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.ceil(math.log10(n[0]) + 1)):
        j = str(n[0])
        while j:
            j = int(j[0]) + str(i)
            if all(int(k) for k in str(j)):
                res.append(int(j))
    return res
