	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 784. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    return sorted(list(filter(left_truncatable_prime, list(range(1, int(nums[0])+1)))))

def left_truncatable_prime(n):
    return all(int(str(n)) for n in range(n, 1, -1))
