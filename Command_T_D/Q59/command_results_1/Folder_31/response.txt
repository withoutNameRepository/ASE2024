	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 50. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    for l in range(2, int(str(n[50])[0] + 1)):
        p = next(x for x in itertools.permutations(str(n)[:50] + str(l)) if all(int(a) for a in str(x)))
        if p <= n and all(int(a) == 1 for a in str(p)):
            yield p
