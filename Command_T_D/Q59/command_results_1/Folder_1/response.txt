	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 20. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools
import re

PRIMES = [(x * 10**n) for n in range(1, len(str(x)) + 1) for x in range(10, 100, 10)]

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    return [x for x in PRIMES if all(int(x) == x for x in str(x)) and str(x).lstrip('0') in str(x) for _ in range(1, len(str(x)) + 1)]
