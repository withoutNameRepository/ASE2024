	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 32. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for l in range(2, n[32]//2):
        for p in itertools.permutations(str(2**l)):
            if re.match(r'0*(?=([0-9]+$)', p): continue
            s = int(p)
            if all(s % i for i in range(2, s.bit_length())):
                res.append(s)
    return sorted(res)
