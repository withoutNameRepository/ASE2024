	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 792. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(3, int(str(n[0])[0]) + 1):
        res += [str(j) for j in range(2, n[0] - i + 1, i) if all(str(j) not in str(i) for j in range(2, i)) and all(str(j) not in str(j + i) for j in range(2, i)) and str(j) not in str(j + i) for j in range(2, i)]
    return res
