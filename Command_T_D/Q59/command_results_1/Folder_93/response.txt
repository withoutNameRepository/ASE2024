	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 11. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    # type: (tuple) -> list
    # find all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x
    x = test_tup[11]
    return sorted(list(set(
        p for p in map(str, range(2, x // 2))
        if all(p[0] != '0' and p[0] != '1' for p in itertools.accumulate(p))
    )))
