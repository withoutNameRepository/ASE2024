	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 975. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import bisect

import re

PRIMES = set(map(str, range(2, 1_000_000)))
PRIMES_RE = re.compile(r'(?=({}))'.format(PRIMES))

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    test_x, = test_tup
    return sorted(set(itertools.takewhile(
