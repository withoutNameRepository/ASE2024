	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 71. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x_tup):
    res = []
    for i in range(x_tup[0], x_tup[1]):
        s = str(i)
        while s[0] != "2":
            if i % 10**(len(s) - 1) == 0:
                break
            elif all(int(d) for d in s[1:]):
                res.append(i)
    return res
