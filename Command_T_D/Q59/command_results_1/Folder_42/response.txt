	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 64. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(2, int(n[0]) + 1):
        if str(i).lstrip("0").rstrip("9") in str(n).lstrip("0"):
            break
        elif i == int(n[0]):
            continue
        elif n[0] - i < len(str(n[0])):
            result += [int(i)]
    return result
