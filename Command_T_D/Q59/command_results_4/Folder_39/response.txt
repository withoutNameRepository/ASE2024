	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 30. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    # your code here
    # sort in descending order
    return sorted(set(itertools.takewhile(
        lambda x: all(str(x)[-1] % d for d in range(2, int(str(x)[-1]) + 1)),
        itertools.permutations(nums)[30]
    )), reverse=True)
