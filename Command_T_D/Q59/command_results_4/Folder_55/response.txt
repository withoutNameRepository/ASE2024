	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 73. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    return [x for x in range(3,int(str(nums[0])[0])+1) if all(x%d!=0 for d in range(2,int(str(x))+1)) and all(str(x)[:i]+str(x)[i+1:]==str(x) for i in range(1,len(str(x))+1))]
