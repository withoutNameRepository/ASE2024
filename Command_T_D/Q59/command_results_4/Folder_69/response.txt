	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 760. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    for p in itertools.permutations(str(n), 2):
        if p[0] != '0' and all(int(q) for q in p[1:]):
            yield int(''.join(p))
    for x in range(2, n):
        for p in itertools.permutations(str(x), 2):
            if p[0] != '0' and all(int(q) for q in p[1:]):
                yield int(''.join(p))
