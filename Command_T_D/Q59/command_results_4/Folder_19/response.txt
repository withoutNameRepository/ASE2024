	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 67. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    a, b, c, d = n[2], n[4], n[6], n[8]
    l = [str(a), str(b), str(c), str(d)]
    return [int(i) for i in sorted(l, reverse=True) if all(int(i) for i in str(int(i)) if i != '0' and i != '1' and int(i) > 1)]
