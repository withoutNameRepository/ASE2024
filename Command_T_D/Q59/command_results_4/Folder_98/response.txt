	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 8. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for ele in range(test_tup[0], test_tup[1] + 1):
        while str(ele).rstrip("0") in str(ele).rstrip("0") + str(ele)[1:]:
            ele += 1
        if is_prime(ele):
            res.append(ele)
    return res
