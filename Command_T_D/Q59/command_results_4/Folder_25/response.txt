	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 92. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    x = test_tup[92]
    for i in range(3, x // 2):
        temp = str(i)
        while temp[0] == "0":
            temp = temp[1:]
        if all(int(d) for d in temp):
            res.append(i)
    return res
