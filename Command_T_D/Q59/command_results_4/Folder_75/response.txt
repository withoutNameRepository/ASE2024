	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 41. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[41]
    return sorted(x//10**i for i in range(1, int(str(x).count("0"))+1) if all(str(x//10**i).rstrip("0") % 10**j in "2357" for j in range(1, int(str(x).count("0"))+1)))
