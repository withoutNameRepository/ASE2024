	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 945. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = [str(x) for x in range(2, int(test_tup[0]) + 1) if all(x%d == 0 for d in range(2, int(str(x)) + 1) if x%d != 0)]
    return sorted(res)
