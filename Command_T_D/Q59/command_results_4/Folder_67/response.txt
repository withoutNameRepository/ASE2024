	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 71. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re
import itertools

PRIMES = list(range(2, 10**6))
PRIMES = [i for i in PRIMES if all(a == '9' or a == '0' or i % int(a) == 0 for a in str(i))]

def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    x = tup[71]
    return sorted(set(PRIMES) - set(n for n in PRIMES if any(n % int(a) == 0 for a in str(n)[:-1])), reverse=True)
