	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 85. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    res = []
    for i in range(nums[85] // 10):
        s = str(10 ** i)
        while s:
            p = int(s)
            if all(p % d == 0 for d in range(2, int(s[0]))) and p in nums and p not in res:
                res.append(p)
            s = s[1:]
    return sorted(res)
