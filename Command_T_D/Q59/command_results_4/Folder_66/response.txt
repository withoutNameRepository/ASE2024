	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 25. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(2, int(n[25]) + 1):
        p = str(i)
        while p and p[0] == '0':
            p = p[1:]
        if not p:
            break
        elif all(int(p[0]) % j != 0 for j in range(2, int(p[0]) + 1)):
            res.append(int(p))
    return res
