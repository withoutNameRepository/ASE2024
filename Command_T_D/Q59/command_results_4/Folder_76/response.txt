	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 370. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(test_tup):
    res = []
    for el in range(10, test_tup[0]):
        p = str(el)
        while p != '':
            if all(p[0] != d for d in range(10)):
                break
            p = p[1:]
        else:
            continue
        if all(str(el - d) in '2357' for d in range(1, el // 2)):
            res.append(el)
