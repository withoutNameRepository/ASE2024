	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 55. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(tup):
    x = tup[55]
    lst = []
    for p in itertools.permutations_with_replacement([1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19], 5):
        tmp = int("".join(str(p)))
        while tmp < x:
            if all(p % d == 0 for d in range(2, tmp // 10)):
                break
            tmp += 1
            if all(p % d == 0 for d in range(2, tmp // 10)):
                break
            lst.append(p)
    return lst
