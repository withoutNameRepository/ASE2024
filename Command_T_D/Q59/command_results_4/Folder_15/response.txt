	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 6. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(num_tup):
    res = []
    for n in range(num_tup[6]):
        s = str(n)
        i = 1
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i] == '0':
                break
            elif i == 1 or s[i - 1] == '0':
                res.append(int(s[0]))
            i += 1
    return res
