	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 175. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in ascending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(3, n[0] + 1):
        temp = str(i)
        while temp[0] != '9' and len(temp) > 1:
            temp = temp[1:]
            if str(int(temp)) in result:
                break
            elif len(temp) == 1:
                result.append(int(temp))
            else:
                result += str(int(temp))
    return sorted(result)
