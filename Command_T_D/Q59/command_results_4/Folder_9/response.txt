	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 29. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    # create a list of all the primes less than the given number
    primes = []
    # create a variable to store the number being tested
    num = 2
    # loop until the number is equal to the given number
    while num <= x:
        # if the number is prime, add it to the list of primes
        if all(num % i for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1)):
            primes.append(num)
        # move to the next number
        num += 1
    # return the list of primes
    return sorted(set(primes))
