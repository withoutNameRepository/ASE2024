	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_left_truncatable_prime' that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. Let x be the integer at index 975. The function should return the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The return list should be sorted in descending order. A left-truncatable prime number is a prime number that contains no 0 and if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import itertools

def all_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    x = n[-1]
    # Find all left-truncatable primes less than x
    return sorted(list(filter(lambda n: all(n % d for d in range(2, int(n ** .5) + 1)),  # n is prime
                             (n for n in itertools.permutations(str(x)) if all(int(i) for i in str(n))))))
