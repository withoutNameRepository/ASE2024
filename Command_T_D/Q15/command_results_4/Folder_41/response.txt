Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_odd_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
