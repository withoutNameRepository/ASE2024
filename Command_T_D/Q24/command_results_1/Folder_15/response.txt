	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_of_divisors_in_range' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 7 and 9, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    s = sum(list(range(7, n // 2 + 1, 2)))
    if n % 2 == 1:
        s += n - 7
    if n > 2:
        s += n - 8
    return s
