	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_of_divisors_in_range' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 4 and 7, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    elif n < 6:
        return sum(d for d in range(4, n // 2) if n % d == 0)
    else:
