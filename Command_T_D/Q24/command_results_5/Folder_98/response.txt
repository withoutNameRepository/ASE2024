	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_of_divisors_in_range' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 3 and 8, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python

    if n < 3 or n > 8:
        return 0
    divisors = []
    for i in range(3, int(n ** .5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors += [[i]]
            if i * i != n:
