	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_of_divisors_in_range' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 6 and 7, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

        return 0
    sum_of_divisors = 1
    for i in range(1, int(n ** .5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum_of_divisors += i + n / i
