	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_of_divisors_in_range' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 4 and 5, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(x):
    if x <= 4:
        return 0
    for i in range(4, x // 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            continue
        else:
            break
    return i * i + (x - i) * (x - i - 1)
