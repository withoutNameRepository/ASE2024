	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_of_divisors_in_range' that takes a positive integer as its argument, and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 8 and 9, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    if n < 8 or n > 9:
        return 0
    if n == 8 or n == 9:
        return 1
    return 1 + sum(range(8, n, 2)) + sum(range(9, n, 3))
