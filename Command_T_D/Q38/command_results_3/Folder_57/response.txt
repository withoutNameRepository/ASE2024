	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 92.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    if not s:
        return 1
    m = 1
    x = 1
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i < n:
            m = m * x
        else:
            break
        x = x * (len(s)-i-1)
