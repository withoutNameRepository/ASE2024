	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 63.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    return sys.set_recursion_limit(10**5) # 10**5 is a good number.
    return s.count(1) * 2 ** (len(s) - 1) # This is the formula.
