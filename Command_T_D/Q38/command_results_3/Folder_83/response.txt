	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 95.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

# Calculate the factorial of 95
fac95 = 1
for i in range(1, 95 + 1):
    fac95 *= i
