	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 801.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    return 1 if len(s) == 1 else 1 + sum(
        find_subset_of_length_n(s[:i]) + find_subset_of_length_n(s[:i] + s[i+1:])
        for i in range(1, len(s))
