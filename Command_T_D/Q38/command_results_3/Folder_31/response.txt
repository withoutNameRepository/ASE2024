	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 66.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    return 1 if n == 0 else find_subset_of_length_n(s) + find_subset_of_length_n(s, 1) + find_subset_of_length_n(s, 2) + find_subset_of_length_n(s, 3) + find_subset_of_length_n(s, 4) + find_subset_of_length_n(s, 5) + find_subset_of_length_n(s, 6)
