	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 616.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(1_000_000)

from functools import reduce
from operator import mul
from collections import Counter

def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):
    c = Counter(set_of_elements)
    num_of_subsets = reduce(mul, map(v for v in c.values() if v >= 616), 1)
    return num_of_subsets
