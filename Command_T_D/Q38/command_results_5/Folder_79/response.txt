	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 63.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    n = len(s)
    return 1 if n == 0 or n == 1 else 1 + (n - 2) * find_subset_of_length_n(s[:-1])

s = set(input().split())
print(find_subset_of_length_n(s))
