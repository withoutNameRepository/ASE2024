	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 100.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):
    return {x: x * (len(set_of_elements) - x) for x in range(len(set_of_elements))}.get(100, 0)
