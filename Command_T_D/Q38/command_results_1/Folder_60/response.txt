	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 88.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=10**6)
def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    if len(s) < 88:
        return 0
    return sum(find_subset_of_length_n(x) for x in s)
