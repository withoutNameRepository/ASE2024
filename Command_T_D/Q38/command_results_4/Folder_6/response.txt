	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 89.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```
import math

    # calculate the total number of possible subsets of size 89
    # by calculating the number of permutations of the set
    # taking into account the number of possible ways to
    # select 89 elements from a set of size N
    return math.factorial(len(set)) / math.factorial(89) / math.factorial(len(set)-89)
