	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 36.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import math

def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    return math.factorial(len(s)) / math.factorial(len(s)-36)
