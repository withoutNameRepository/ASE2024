	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 86.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys
input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
    num = 0
    for i in range(len(set)):
        if len(set) - i >= 86:
            num += 1
    return num
