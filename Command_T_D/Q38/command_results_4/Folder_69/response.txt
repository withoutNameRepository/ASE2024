	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 894.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

def find_subset_of_length_n(nums):
    return 1 if len(nums) == 0 else 1 + find_subset_of_length_n(nums[:-1])
