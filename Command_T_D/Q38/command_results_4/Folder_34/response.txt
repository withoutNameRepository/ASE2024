	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 97.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import sys

def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        res += sys.pow(len(s)-i, 96)
    return res
