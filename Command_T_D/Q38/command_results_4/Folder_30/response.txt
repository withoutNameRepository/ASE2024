	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 94.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):
    n = 94
    count = 1
    for element in set_of_elements:
        count *= n - len(set_of_elements) + 1
    return count
