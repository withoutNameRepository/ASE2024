	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 20.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    return (1 if n == 0 else 1 + sum(find_subset_of_length_n(s) for n in range(1, len(s) + 1))) * 2**(len(s) - n)
