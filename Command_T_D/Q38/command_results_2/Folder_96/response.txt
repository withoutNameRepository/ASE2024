	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 47.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python

    # function to find the number of all its subsets of size 47
    # takes one argument, a set of elements
    # returns the number of all its subsets of size 47
    cnt = Counter(set_of_elements)
