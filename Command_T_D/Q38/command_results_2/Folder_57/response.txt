	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 92.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(S):
    return 1 if not S else find_subset_of_length_n(S[:92]) + find_subset_of_length_n(S[92:]) + find_subset_of_length_n(S[:92]) * len(S[92:])
