	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 534.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):
    # Take a look at: http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/10/13/efficient- calculation-of-permutations-in-python/
    return len(set_of_elements) ** (len(set_of_elements) - 1) // (2 ** (len(set_of_elements) - 1))
