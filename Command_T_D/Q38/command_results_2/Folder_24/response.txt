	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 74.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    n = 74
    result = 0
    for element in set_of_elements:
        result += 1**n
        n -= 1
    return result
