	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_in_range' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 4 and 9, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

        if nums[i] >= 4 and nums[i] <= 9:
            result += nums[i]
    return result
