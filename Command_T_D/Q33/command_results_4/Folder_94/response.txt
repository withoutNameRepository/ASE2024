	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 40 (inclusive) and index 94 (exclusive) that are greater than character 4 and smaller than or equal to character H. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    return [i for i in range(40, 94, 1) if i > 4 and i <= 'H' and s[i]]
