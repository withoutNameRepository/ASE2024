	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 51 (inclusive) and index 77 (exclusive) that are greater than character 4 and smaller than or equal to character =. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return [x for x in range(51, 77) if s[x-1] > 4 and x <= len(s)]
