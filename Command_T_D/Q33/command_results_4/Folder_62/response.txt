	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 14 (inclusive) and index 60 (exclusive) that are greater than character D and smaller than or equal to character v. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import re

def return_vowels(s):
    m = re.findall(r'[aeiou]([A-Z])', s)
    return [c for c in m if c[0] > 'D' and c[1] <= 'v']
