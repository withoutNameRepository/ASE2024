	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 54 (inclusive) and index 82 (exclusive) that are greater than character = and smaller than or equal to character @. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    res = []
    for i in range(s.find("="), s.find(" @"), -1):
        if s[i] in "AEIOU":
            res.append(s[i])
