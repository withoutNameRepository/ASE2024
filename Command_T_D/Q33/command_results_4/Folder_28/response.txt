	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 41 (inclusive) and index 50 (exclusive) that are greater than character W and smaller than or equal to character [. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def return_vowels(s):
    m = re.match(r'[A-Z][^W][.EIOU]{%d,%d}' % (41, 50), s)
    return [i for i in range(m.end() - 1, m.start() - 1, -1) if s[i].isalpha() and s[i] in 'AEIOU']
