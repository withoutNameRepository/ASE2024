	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 71 (inclusive) and index 81 (exclusive) that are greater than character > and smaller than or equal to character U. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

import re

def return_vowels(s):
    r = re.findall(r"([a-z])\d", s)
    return [x for x in r if x[0] in range(71, 81, 1)]
