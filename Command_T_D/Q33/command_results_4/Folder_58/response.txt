	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 260 (inclusive) and index 322 (exclusive) that are greater than character % and smaller than or equal to character U. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    return [c for c in range(ord("A") + 1, ord("Z") + 1) if c in range(ord("%") + 1, ord("U") + 1) and c in s]
