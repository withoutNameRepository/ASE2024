	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 77 (inclusive) and index 84 (exclusive) that are greater than character ( and smaller than or equal to character G. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    lst = []
    for i in range(77, 84):
        if i > ord(s[0]) and i <= ord('G'):
            lst.append(chr(i))
    return lst
