	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 528 (inclusive) and index 606 (exclusive) that are greater than character M and smaller than or equal to character X. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    vowels = [i for i in range(528, 606) if s[i] in 'AEIOU']
    return [s[i] for i in vowels if s[i] > 'M' and s[i] <= 'X']
