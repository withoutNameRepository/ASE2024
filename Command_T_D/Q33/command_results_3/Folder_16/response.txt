	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 133 (inclusive) and index 306 (exclusive) that are greater than character c and smaller than or equal to character d. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    if m:
        start, stop, c = int(m.group(1)), int(m.group(2)), m.group(3)
