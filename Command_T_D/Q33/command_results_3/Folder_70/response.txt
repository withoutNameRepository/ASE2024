	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 171 (inclusive) and index 402 (exclusive) that are greater than character I and smaller than or equal to character k. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def return_vowels(text):
    text = re.sub(r'[^A-z]', '', text)
    text = text[171:-1]
    text = text[:text.index('k')]
    return [c for c in text if c.lower() in 'aeiou']
