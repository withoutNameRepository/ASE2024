	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 70 (inclusive) and index 76 (exclusive) that are greater than character 2 and smaller than or equal to character :. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    start, end = 2, len(text)-1
    while start <= end:
