From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 64 (inclusive) and index 82 (exclusive) that are greater than character P and smaller than or equal to character z. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(str1):
    res = []
    for i in range(64, 82):
        if str1[i] in 'AEIOUaeiou':
            res.append(str1[i])
