	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 5 (inclusive) and index 6 (exclusive) that are greater than character 3 and smaller than or equal to character ^. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    str1 = "<[A-E]>"
    str2 = "<[I-O]"
    str3 = "<[U-Z]"
    s = re.sub(str1, "", s)
    s = re.sub(str2, "", s)
    s = re.sub(str3, "", s)
