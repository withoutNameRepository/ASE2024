	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 63 (inclusive) and index 79 (exclusive) that are greater than character D and smaller than or equal to character y. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(str):
    res = []
    for i in range(63, 79):
        if str[i] > 'd' and str[i] <= 'y':
            res.append(str[i])
