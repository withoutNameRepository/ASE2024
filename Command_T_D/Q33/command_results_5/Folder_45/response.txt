	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 43 (inclusive) and index 70 (exclusive) that are greater than character * and smaller than or equal to character b. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    lst = [c for c in s[43:-1] if c.isalpha()]
    return [c for c in lst if c.lower() in 'aeiou']
