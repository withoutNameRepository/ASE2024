	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 328 (inclusive) and index 455 (exclusive) that are greater than character < and smaller than or equal to character z. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
	text: 
```python
import re

def return_vowels(text):
    return [c for c in text if c.isalpha() and c.isupper() and c in re.findall(r'[A-Z][^<z]')]
