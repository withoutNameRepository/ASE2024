From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 1 (inclusive) and index 5 (exclusive) that are greater than character ! and smaller than or equal to character j. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    for i in range(1, 5):
        if test_str[i] in 'aeiouAEIOU':
            res += [test_str[i]]
