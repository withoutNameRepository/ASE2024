From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 323 (inclusive) and index 526 (exclusive) that are greater than character + and smaller than or equal to character :. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
