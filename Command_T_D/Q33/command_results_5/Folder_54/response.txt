	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 23 (inclusive) and index 85 (exclusive) that are greater than character W and smaller than or equal to character v. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    vowels = []
    while i < j:
        if s[i] in 'AEIOU' and s[i] > 'W' and s[i] < 'v':
