From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 15 (inclusive) and index 86 (exclusive) that are greater than character @ and smaller than or equal to character ~. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    str1 = re.sub(r'[a-z]','',str1)
    str1 = str1.split('@')[-1]
    str1 = str1.split('~')[0]
