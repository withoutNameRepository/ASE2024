	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 71 (inclusive) and index 88 (exclusive) that are greater than character 9 and smaller than or equal to character P. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def return_vowels(s):
    m = re.match(r'[^A-Z0-9]+', s)
    return [c for c in m.group() if c in range(72, 89) and c != 'P']
