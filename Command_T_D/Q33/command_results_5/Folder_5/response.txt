	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 44 (inclusive) and index 95 (exclusive) that are greater than character 5 and smaller than or equal to character <. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def return_vowels(str1):
    res = []
    for i in range(44, 95):
        if str1[i] > 5 and str1[i] <= '<':
            res.append(str1[i])
    return res
