	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 19 (inclusive) and index 20 (exclusive) that are greater than character < and smaller than or equal to character p. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(test_str):
    res = []
    for index in range(19, 20):
        if test_str[index] > "<" and test_str[index] <= "p":
            res.append(test_str[index])
