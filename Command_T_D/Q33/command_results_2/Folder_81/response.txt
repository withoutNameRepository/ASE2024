From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 20 (inclusive) and index 43 (exclusive) that are greater than character 5 and smaller than or equal to character M. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.
