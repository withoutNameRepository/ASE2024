	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 529 (inclusive) and index 828 (exclusive) that are greater than character U and smaller than or equal to character l. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
def return_vowels(s):
    v = list(s[529:828])
    if v.count("U") > 1:
        v.remove("U")
    if v.count("L") > 1:
        v.remove("L")
    return v
