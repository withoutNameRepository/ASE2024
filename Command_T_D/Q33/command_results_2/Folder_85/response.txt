From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 55 (inclusive) and index 65 (exclusive) that are greater than character Z and smaller than or equal to character w. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    return [c for c in range(ord("a") + 55, ord("z") + 1) if c > ord("z") and c < ord("w")]
