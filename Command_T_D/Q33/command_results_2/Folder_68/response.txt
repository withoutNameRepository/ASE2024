From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 1 (inclusive) and index 9 (exclusive) that are greater than character ? and smaller than or equal to character k. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    str1 = re.sub(r'[^A-Z]','',str1)
    str1 = str1[1:-1]
