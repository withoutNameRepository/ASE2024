	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 149 (inclusive) and index 313 (exclusive) that are greater than character M and smaller than or equal to character j. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

    return [ch for ch in range(149, 313) if ch in s and ch.isupper() and ch.isalpha() and ch.isalnum() and ch > 'M' and ch <= 'j']
