From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 8 (inclusive) and index 9 (exclusive) that are greater than character Y and smaller than or equal to character s. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

def return_vowels(s):
    return [i for i in range(8, 9) if i in s and re.search(r'[aeiouy]', s[i:])]
