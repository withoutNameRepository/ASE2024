	prompt: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index 45 (inclusive) and index 76 (exclusive) that are greater than character b and smaller than or equal to character z. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should not contain any comments. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks.

```python
import re

def return_vowels(s):
    return [ch for ch in range(45,76,1) if ch>='b' and ch<='z' and re.match(r'[aeiou]', s[ch-45:ch+1])]
