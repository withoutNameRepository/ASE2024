Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['+x5r99UZS*eY  =&eVD$8% s3F0qsz38B>8BR C&7h7P=192Vh$2l=H<2785$=60h02&&7V  3>kc  1  37%4d1=Y>f2K%67*  9d']

The correct answer was:
+x5r99UZS*eY&eVD%F0qz>RC&P19VlH<5600&&V>kc1%4d1Y>fK%6*9d

But the LLM code returned:
+xrUZS*eYeDFqzRCPlH<6kc4dYfK6*d
