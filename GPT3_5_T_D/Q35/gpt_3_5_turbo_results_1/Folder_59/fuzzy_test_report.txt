Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['2 2 L39 +4 z0w<95 b0 0H2e2P2lx4n%xa$4XRN']

The correct answer was:
22L39+4z0w<95b00H2e2P2lx4n%xa$4XRN

But the LLM code returned:
L3+4z0w<5b00HePlx4n%xa$4XRN
