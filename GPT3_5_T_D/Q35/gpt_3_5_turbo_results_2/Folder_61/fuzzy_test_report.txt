Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['5R0 +lax2340&z4N22b4 H9$9xe< 0L n P9w']

The correct answer was:
5R0 +lax2340&z4N22b4 H9$9xe< 0L n P9w

But the LLM code returned:
5R+la234&z4N22b4H9$9e<LnP9w
