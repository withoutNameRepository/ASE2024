Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[312, 442, 283, -240, 513, -440, 121, -31, -88, -26, 241, 130, 91, -209, -535, -217, 401, -112, 202, 184, -26, -549, 12, 335, 531, 5, 454, -266, 53, 341, -73, 448, 357, -275, 281, -105, 252, 450, 438, -264]

The correct answer was:
[-73, -275, -105]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
