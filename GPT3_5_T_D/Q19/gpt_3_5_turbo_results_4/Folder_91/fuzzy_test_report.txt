Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-309, 370, -421, -28, 464, 417]

The correct answer was:
[370, -421, -28]

But the LLM code returned:
[-309, 370, -421, -28]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
[-88, 283, -105, 312, 12, -266]
