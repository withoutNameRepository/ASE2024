It uses list comprehension to iterate over each character of the string along with its index. If the index is less than 51 or greater than 96, or if the character is less than 'X' or greater than 'p', it includes that character in the new list. Finally, it uses the `join` method to concatenate all the characters in the new list and returns the altered string.",
