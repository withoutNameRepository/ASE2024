Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 31, 34, 37, 40, 44, 48, 59, 61, 63, 65, 68, 70, 71, 77, 79, 80, 83, 84, 89, 92, 93, 95, 96, 97, 98, 101, 102, 103, 104, 110, 111, 113, 115, 116, 119, 120, 122, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 133, 134, 136, 137]

The correct answer was:
62E

But the LLM code returned:
62e

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 29, 34, 37, 40, 43, 45, 46, 47, 51, 52, 53, 58, 65, 66, 69, 70, 72, 75, 78, 79, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 93, 94, 96, 99, 100, 101, 102, 104, 105, 106, 109, 111, 112, 113, 117, 118, 122, 124, 126, 127, 128)

(3) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 34, 37, 45, 49, 51, 52, 57, 61, 64, 65, 66, 71, 78, 79, 82, 83, 85, 87, 89, 92, 93, 94, 96, 98, 99, 100, 102, 103, 106, 108, 109, 111, 115, 116, 117, 118, 120, 121, 122, 123, 126, 128)
