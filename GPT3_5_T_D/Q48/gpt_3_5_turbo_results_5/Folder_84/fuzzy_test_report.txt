Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 35, 49, 52, 57, 58, 59, 63, 64, 65, 81, 87, 88, 91, 93, 97, 100, 103, 105, 106, 108, 109, 113, 114, 115, 119, 120, 121, 123, 124, 127, 128, 130, 133, 134, 138, 139, 141, 143, 144, 145, 146, 148, 149, 152, 155, 156, 157, 159, 160, 162, 163, 167, 168, 171, 174, 175]

The correct answer was:
A46

But the LLM code returned:
196c
