It slices the input list into two parts using the slicing operator `lst[:77]`, which includes all elements up to index 76, and `lst[77:]`, which includes all elements from index 77 onwards. The function then constructs a new list by concatenating the sliced parts with the list `[15, 51]` inserted between them. This new list is the desired result, which is returned by the function.",
