Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-309, 464, 248, -492, -358, -28, 417, 370, -121, -421, 449, 227]

The correct answer was:
[464, 248, 417, 370, 449]

But the LLM code returned:
[464, 248, 417, 370, 449, 227]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
[12, 5, -240, -217, 312, 283, -26, -266, 91, -105, 448, -88]
