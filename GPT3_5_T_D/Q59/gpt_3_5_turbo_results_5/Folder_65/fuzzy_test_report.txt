Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982, 812, 903, 317, 732, 899, 687, 477, 109, 439, 614, 913, 966, 482, 866, 267, 806, 553, 23, 722, 404, 826, 671, 11, 498]

The correct answer was:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 67, 73, 83, 97, 113, 137, 167, 173, 197, 223]

But the LLM code returned:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 23, 37, 43, 47, 53, 67, 73, 83, 97, 103, 107, 113, 137, 167, 173, 197, 223]
