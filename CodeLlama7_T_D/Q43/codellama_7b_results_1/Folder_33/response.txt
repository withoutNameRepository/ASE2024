 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_primes_between_indices` function:
```python
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    prime_numbers = []

    # Iterate over the list from index 307 to index 482, inclusive
    for i in range(307, 483):
        # Check if the current element is a prime number
        if is_prime(my_list[i]):
            # Add the prime number to the list of prime numbers
            prime_numbers.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 307 to index 482, inclusive
    return sorted(prime_numbers)

# Define a function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    # Check if n is greater than 1
    if n > 1:
        # Iterate from 2 to the square root of n
        for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
            # Check if i divides n
            if n % i == 0:
                # If i divides n, then n is not prime
                return False

    # If n is greater than 1 and it is not divisible by any number between 2 and the square root of n, then it is prime
    return True
```
