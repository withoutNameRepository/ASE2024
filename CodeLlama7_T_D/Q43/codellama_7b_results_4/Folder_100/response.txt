 ```
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(25, 63):
        if is_prime(my_list[i]):
            prime_numbers.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function checks if a given number is prime by iterating up to the square root of that number and checking if any factors are found. This is not the most efficient way to check for primality, but it should be sufficient for this problem.
