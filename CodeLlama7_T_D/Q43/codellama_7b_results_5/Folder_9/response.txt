 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_primes_between_indices` function in Python:
```
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the prime numbers
    prime_numbers = []

    # Iterate over the list from index 22 to index 69, both inclusive
    for i in range(22, 70):
        # Check if the current element is a prime number using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
        if my_list[i] == 1:
            # If the current element is a prime number, add it to the list of prime numbers
            prime_numbers.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 22 to index 69, both inclusive
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
