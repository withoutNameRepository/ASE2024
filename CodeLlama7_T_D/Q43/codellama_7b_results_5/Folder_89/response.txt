 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_primes_between_indices` function:
```
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    # Find the first prime number in the range
    start = next((i for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if is_prime(x)), None)
    # If there are no prime numbers in the range, return an empty list
    if start is None:
        return []

    # Find the last prime number in the range
    end = next((i for i, x in enumerate(my_list[start:]) if is_prime(x)), None)
    # If there are no prime numbers in the range, return an empty list
    if end is None:
        return []

    # Return the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 86 to index 93, both inclusive
    return sorted([my_list[i] for i in range(start, start + end)])
```
This code uses a generator expression to find the first and last prime numbers in the specified range. If there are no prime numbers in the range, an empty list is returned. Otherwise, the function returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 86 to index 93, both inclusive.
