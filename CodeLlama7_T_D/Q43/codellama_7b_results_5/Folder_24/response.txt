 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_primes_between_indices` function:
```python
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    prime_numbers = []

    # Iterate over the list from index 15 to index 98, both inclusive
    for i in range(15, len(my_list)):
        # Check if the current element is a prime number
        if is_prime(my_list[i]):
            # If it is a prime number, add it to the list of prime numbers
            prime_numbers.append(my_list[i])

    # Sort the list of prime numbers in descending order
    prime_numbers.sort(reverse=True)

    # Return the sorted list of prime numbers
    return prime_numbers
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the `is_prime` function is already defined and works correctly.
