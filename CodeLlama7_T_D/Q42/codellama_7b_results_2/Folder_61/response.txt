 Here is a possible implementation of the `prime_factors` function:
```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    # Get the number at index 8
    num = numbers[8]
    # Initialize an empty set to store the prime factors
    prime_factors = set()
    # Loop through all the divisors of the number
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        # If the current divisor is a prime factor of the number
        if num % i == 0:
            # Add the prime factor to the set of prime factors
            prime_factors.add(i)
    return prime_factors
```
This implementation uses a for loop to iterate through all the divisors of the number at index 8 in the list of numbers, and checks if each divisor is also a prime factor using the `is_prime` function from the previous exercise. If a divisor is a prime factor, it is added to the set of prime factors. Finally, the function returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 8 in the list of numbers.
