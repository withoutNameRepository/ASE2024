 Here is a possible implementation of the `prime_factors` function:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2

    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i

    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return set(factors)
```
This function takes a single argument `n`, which is a list of positive integers. It returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 83 in the input list.
The function first checks if the input number is even, and if so, it adds 2 as a factor and divides the number by 2 until it is no longer even. This is done using a loop that continues until the number is no longer even.
Next, the function checks if the input number is odd and greater than 1. If so, it adds the number as a factor and returns the set of all prime factors found so far.
If the input number is not odd or greater than 1, the function continues to check if the number is divisible by any other odd numbers up to the square root of the number. If it is, the function adds that odd number as a factor and divides the number by that odd number until it is no longer divisible by it. This is done using another loop that continues until the number is no longer divisible by any odd number up to the square root of the number.
Once all odd numbers up to the square root of the number have been checked, the function checks if the input number is still greater than 1. If so, the function adds the input number as a factor and returns the set of all prime factors found so far.
If the input number is not greater than 1, the function returns an empty set, indicating that there are no prime factors of the input number.
