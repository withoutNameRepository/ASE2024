This code defines a function called `prime_factors` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function calculates the product of all elements in the list and then uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the prime factors of the product. The prime factors are returned as a set.
The function is tested with a list of positive integers. The output shows the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 162, which is 439804901.
