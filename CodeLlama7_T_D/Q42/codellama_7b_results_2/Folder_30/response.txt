This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 94 in the list.
The function first finds the number at index 94 in the list and assigns it to the variable `num`.
It then initializes an empty set called `factors` to store the prime factors of `num`.
Next, the function uses a loop to iterate over the numbers from 2 to the square root of `num`, which is calculated using the formula `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`.
Inside the loop, the function checks if `num` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, the function adds `i` to the set `factors` and updates `num` by dividing it by `i`.
The function continues iterating over the numbers in the range until `num` reaches 1. At this point, all prime factors of `num` have been found and stored in the set `factors`.
Finally, the function returns the set `factors`, which contains all prime factors of the integer at index 94 in the list.
