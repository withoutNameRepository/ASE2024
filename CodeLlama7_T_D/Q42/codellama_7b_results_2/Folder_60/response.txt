Explanation:

The `prime_factors` function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 88.
The `prime_factorize` function is defined recursively. If the input integer is equal to 1, it returns [1]. Otherwise, it finds the largest factor that divides the input integer, and if that factor is prime (i.e., it is divisible only by 1 and itself), it adds it to a list of factors. It then calls itself recursively with the remainder of the division. When there are no more factors to be found, it returns the list of factors it has built up so far.
In this solution, we use the `set` constructor to convert the list of prime factors into a set, which eliminates any duplicates and ensures that each element in the set is unique.
