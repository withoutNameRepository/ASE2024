 ```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    # Find the number at index 57
    num = my_list[57]
    # Initialize an empty set to store prime factors
    prime_factors = set()
    # Loop through all numbers less than or equal to the square root of num
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        # If num is divisible by i, add i to the set of prime factors
        if num % i == 0:
            prime_factors.add(i)
    return prime_factors
```
Note that this code assumes that the input list has at least 58 elements.
