 ```
def prime_factors(n):
    # Initialize a set to store the prime factors
    factors = set()

    # Iterate from 2 to the square root of n
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        # If i divides n, add it to the set of prime factors
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)

    # Return the set of prime factors
    return factors
```
This function takes a single argument `n`, which is a list of positive integers. It returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 312, which is the first element in the list.
To use this function, you can call it with a list of positive integers as an argument, like this:
```
>>> n = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> prime_factors(n)
{2, 3}
```
This will return the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 312, which is the first element in the list `n`. In this case, the set contains only two elements: 2 and 3.
