 Here is a possible implementation of the `prime_factors` function:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the prime factors
    factors = set()

    # Iterate from 2 to n-1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        # If i divides n without leaving a remainder
        if n % i == 0:
            # Add i to the set of prime factors
            factors.add(i)

    # Return the set of prime factors
    return factors
```
This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is an integer. It then iterates from 2 to `n-1` and checks if each number divides `n` without leaving a remainder. If it does, then that number is added to the set of prime factors. Finally, the function returns the set of prime factors.
Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```
# Test the prime_factors function with the number 97
#print(prime_factors(97))
```
#This code will print out the set of prime factors for the number 97, which is `{[3], [3], [3]}`.
