 Here is the Python code for the function `prime_factors`:
```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    # Find the index of the integer in the list that we want to factorize
    index = 43
    # Get the value of the integer at the specified index
    num = my_list[index]
    # Initialize an empty set to store the prime factors
    prime_factors = set()
    # Loop through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        # If the current number is a factor of the input number, add it to the set of prime factors
        if num % i == 0:
            prime_factors.add(i)
    return prime_factors
```
This code defines a function called `prime_factors` that takes a single argument - a list of positive integers. The function then finds the index of the integer in the list that we want to factorize and gets the value of the integer at that index. It initializes an empty set to store the prime factors and loops through all numbers from 2 to the square root of the input number. If the current number is a factor of the input number, it adds it to the set of prime factors. Finally, the function returns the set of prime factors.
