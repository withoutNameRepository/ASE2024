This code defines a function called `prime_factors` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 74. The function uses a while loop to repeatedly divide the number by its smallest prime factor until it reaches 1, and updates the set of prime factors accordingly.
#To test the function with a sample list of integers, we can pass in a list of numbers and print the set of prime factors returned by the `prime_factors` function.
