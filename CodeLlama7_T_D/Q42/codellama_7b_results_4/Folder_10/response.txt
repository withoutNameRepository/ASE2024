def prime_factors(my_list):
return {p for p in my_list if my_list[54] % p == 0}
```
Explanation:

* The function `prime_factors` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 54.
* We use a set comprehension to generate the set of prime factors. The set comprehension `{p for p in my_list if my_list[54] % p == 0}` generates a set of all prime numbers `p` that divide evenly into the integer at index 54, which is `my_list[54]`.
* Note that this function assumes that the input list has an index 54. If the input list does not have enough elements, the function will throw an error.
