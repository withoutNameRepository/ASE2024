def prime_factors(my_list):
return {x for x in my_list if is_prime(x)}
def is_prime(n):
if n < 2: return False
for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
if n % i == 0: return False
return True

my_list = [746]
#print(prime_factors(my_list))
```
This code defines a function `prime_factors` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 746. The function uses a generator expression to find all the prime numbers in the range `[2, sqrt(n) + 1)`, where `n` is the number being factored.
The code also defines a helper function `is_prime` that takes an integer as input and returns `True` if it is prime and `False` otherwise. This function uses the modulo operator `%` to check whether a number is divisible by any of its factors, and the `range()` function to generate all the possible factors.
Finally, the code demonstrates how to call the `prime_factors` function on a list containing only one integer (746 in this case). The output should be the set of prime factors of 746, which are 2 and 371.
