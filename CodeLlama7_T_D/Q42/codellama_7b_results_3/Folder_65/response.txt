def prime_factors(my_list):
return {p for p in my_list if isprime(p)}
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 35. It uses a set comprehension to generate the set of prime factors. The `isprime` function is used to check whether a number is prime or not.
