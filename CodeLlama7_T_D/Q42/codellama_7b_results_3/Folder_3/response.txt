The function takes a list as input and returns a set containing all the prime factors of the integer at index 100 in the list. The function first finds the number at index 100 in the list, then initializes an empty set to store the prime factors. It then loops through the range of numbers from 2 to the square root of the number and checks if each number is divisible by the current number. If a number is divisible, it adds the number to the set of prime factors. Finally, the function returns the set of prime factors.
