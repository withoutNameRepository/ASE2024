 Here's a possible implementation of the `prime_factors` function:
```python
def prime_factors(n):
    # Find all factors of n
    factors = []
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            factors.extend(prime_factors(n // i))
    return set(factors)
```
This function takes a single argument `n`, which is the integer for which we want to find all prime factors.
The function first finds all factors of `n` by iterating over the numbers from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` (inclusive), and checking if each number divides evenly into `n`. If a factor is found, it is added to the list of factors, and the function recursively calls itself with the new value for `n`.
Once all prime factors have been found, the function returns them as a set.
