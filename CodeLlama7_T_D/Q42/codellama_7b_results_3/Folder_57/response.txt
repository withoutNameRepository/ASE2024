 Here is a possible implementation of the `prime_factors` function in Python:
```
def prime_factors(numbers):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the prime factors
    prime_factors = set()

    # Iterate over the input list of numbers
    for number in numbers:
        # Check if the current number is a prime factor
        if is_prime_factor(number, numbers):
            # Add the prime factor to the set
            prime_factors.add(number)

    return prime_factors
```
This implementation uses a `set` data structure to store the prime factors, which allows for efficient lookups and removal of duplicate prime factors. The `is_prime_factor` function is used to check if a given number is a prime factor of any other number in the input list. If a number is found to be a prime factor of another number, it is added to the set of prime factors.
