 Here's an example of how you could write a function called `prime_factors` that takes a list of positive integers and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 57:
```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    # Check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(my_list, list)):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list")
    # Get the number of elements in the list
    num_elements = len(my_list)
    # Check if the index is valid
    if 57 >= num_elements:
        raise IndexError("Index out of range")
    # Get the integer at index 57
    target_number = my_list[57]
    # Initialize an empty set to store prime factors
    prime_factors = set()
    # Iterate over the factors of the target number
    for factor in range(1, int(target_number ** 0.5) + 1):
        if target_number % factor == 0:
            # If the factor is prime, add it to the set of prime factors
            if is_prime(factor):
                prime_factors.add(factor)
    return prime_factors
```
This function first checks if the input is a list and throws an error if it is not. Then it gets the number of elements in the list and checks if the index is valid. If the index is invalid, it throws an IndexError. Finally, it gets the integer at index 57 and initializes an empty set to store the prime factors. It then iterates over the factors of the target number using a loop, and for each factor, it checks if it is prime and adds it to the set of prime factors if it is. Finally, it returns the set of prime factors.
