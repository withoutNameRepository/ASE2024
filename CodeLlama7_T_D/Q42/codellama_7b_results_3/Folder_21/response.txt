This code defines a function `prime_factors` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 410. The function uses another helper function called `is_prime` to check if a given number is prime or not.
The `is_prime` function checks if a given number is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number and checking if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it means that the number is prime.
#In the main code, we define a list `my_list` that contains all the integers from 1 to 410. We then pass this list to the `prime_factors` function and print the result. The output should be the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 410 in the list, which is 23 and 79.
