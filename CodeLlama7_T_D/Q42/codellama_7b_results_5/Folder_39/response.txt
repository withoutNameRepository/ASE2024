 ```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    return set(prime_factorize(my_list[59]))
```
Explanation:

The function `prime_factors` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 59 in the list.
To find the prime factors, we first use the `prime_factorize` function to factorize the integer at index 59 into its prime factors. We then convert this result to a set using the built-in `set()` function.
This solution assumes that the input list contains at least one element. If the input list is empty or has no elements, an error will be raised when we try to access the integer at index 59 in the list.
