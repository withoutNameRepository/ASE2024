 Here is a possible implementation of the `prime_factors` function:
```
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i

    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)

    return set(factors)
```
This function takes a single argument, `n`, which is a list of positive integers. It returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 100 in the input list. The function uses a loop to iterate over the range of possible prime factors (from 2 to the square root of the input number plus 1), and it uses modular arithmetic to determine whether each possible factor is actually a prime factor of the input number. If a prime factor is found, it is added to the set of all prime factors and the input number is updated accordingly. The function continues until no more prime factors can be found, at which point the final set of prime factors is returned.
