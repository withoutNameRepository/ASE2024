This code defines a function `prime_factors` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the set of prime factors of the integer at index 73. The function uses a generator expression to create a set of all prime factors of the input list. The is_prime function checks if a number is prime by iterating over the numbers less than or equal to its square root and checking if they are divisors of the number.
