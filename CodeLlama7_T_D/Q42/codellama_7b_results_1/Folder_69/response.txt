 ```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    return set(prime_factors)
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 459.
Here's how to use this function:
1. First, create a list of positive integers that you want to find the prime factors for.
2. Then, pass this list to the `prime_factors` function and store the result in a variable.
#3. Finally, print the variable to see the set of all prime factors.
For example:
```
my_list = [14, 21, 28]
prime_factors(my_list)
# Output: {2, 7}
```
In this example, the `prime_factors` function is passed a list of positive integers (`[14, 21, 28]`) and returns the set of all prime factors (`{2, 7}`).
