 ```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    # Find the number at index 66
    num = my_list[66]
    # Initialize an empty set to store the prime factors
    prime_factors = set()
    # Iterate from 2 to the square root of the number
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        # If the number is divisible by i, it is not prime
        if num % i == 0:
            # Add i to the set of prime factors
            prime_factors.add(i)
    return prime_factors
```
Note that this code uses the `**` operator to raise a number to a power, and the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers.
