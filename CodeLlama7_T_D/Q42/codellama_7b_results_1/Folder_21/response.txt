 Here is a possible implementation of the `prime_factors` function:
```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    # Find the number at index 410
    target_number = numbers[410]
    # Initialize an empty set to store the prime factors
    prime_factors = set()
    # Iterate through all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the target number
    for i in range(2, int(target_number ** 0.5) + 1):
        # If the current number is a factor of the target number, add it to the set of prime factors
        if target_number % i == 0:
            prime_factors.add(i)
    return prime_factors
```
This implementation first finds the target number at index 410 in the list of numbers. It then initializes an empty set to store the prime factors, and iterates through all the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the target number. For each prime number `i`, it checks if it is a factor of the target number by dividing the target number by `i` and checking if the result is zero. If so, it adds the current prime number `i` to the set of prime factors. Finally, it returns the set of prime factors as the result of the function call.
