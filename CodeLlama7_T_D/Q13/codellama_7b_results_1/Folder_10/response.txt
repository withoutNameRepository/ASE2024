def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if len(my_list) == 0:
        return None

    # Find the second largest element
    second_largest = None
    for i in range(25, 60):
        if my_list[i] > second_largest or second_largest is None:
            second_largest = my_list[i]
    return second_largest
```
Here's an explanation of the code:
* The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input, and returns the second largest element from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return `None`.
* We check if the list is empty by checking its length. If the list is empty, we return `None` immediately.
* We use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. For each element, we check if it is greater than the current second largest element, and update the second largest element accordingly. If there is no such element in the specified range, we return `None`.
* Finally, we return the second largest element from the specified range.
