This code defines a function `find_second_largest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input. The function then iterates through the elements of the list starting from index 661 to index 924, and for each element it checks if it is greater than the current second largest element or not. If an element is found to be greater than the current second largest element, then it becomes the new second largest element. The function returns the second largest element found in the list, or None if no such element was found.
