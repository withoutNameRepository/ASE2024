 ```
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    # Check if list is empty
    if len(my_list) == 0:
        return None

    # Find the second largest element in the list
    second_largest = None
    for i in range(30, 201):
        if my_list[i] > second_largest:
            second_largest = my_list[i]
    return second_largest
```
Note that this function assumes that the list of numbers is sorted in ascending order. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code to handle unsorted lists.
