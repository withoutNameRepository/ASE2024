def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
if len(my_list) < 29:
return None

else:

return sorted(my_list)[28]
```
Explanation:
The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input. It first checks if the length of the list is less than 29, because we want to find the second largest element from index 28 to index 32, both inclusive. If the length of the list is less than 29, then there is no such element and the function returns None.
If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 29, then we can find the second largest element from index 28 to index 32, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list using the sorted() function, which returns a new sorted list based on the elements in the original list. It then returns the second largest element from index 28 to index 32, both inclusive, by indexing into the sorted list and returning the element at index 28.
For example, if the input list is [10, 5, 12, 8, 20], the function will return 12, because it is the second largest element from index 28 to index 32, both inclusive.
