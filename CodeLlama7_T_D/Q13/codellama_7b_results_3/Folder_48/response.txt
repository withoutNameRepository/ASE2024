 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_second_largest_num` function:
```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    # Check if the input list has at least two elements
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return None

    # Get the indices of the largest element
    max_idx = numbers.index(max(numbers))

    # If there is no second largest element, return None
    if max_idx == 0 or max_idx == len(numbers) - 1:
        return None

    # Return the second largest element
    else:
        return numbers[max_idx - 1]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index `533` to index `605`, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return `None`.
