This code defines a function called `find_second_largest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return `None`.
The function works by first checking if the length of the input list is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns `None` as there are no elements in the list that can be considered the second largest.
If the length of the input list is greater than 1, the function then finds the largest element in the list by iterating through each element and comparing them to one another. It does this by storing the current largest element in a variable called `largest`, and then updating it with each iteration if the current element is larger.
Once the largest element has been found, the function then finds the second largest element by iterating through each element again and comparing them to one another. It does this by storing the current second largest element in a variable called `second_largest`, and then updating it with each iteration if the current element is larger than the previous largest element but smaller than the current largest element.
Finally, the function returns the second largest element that it found, or `None` if there was no such element.
