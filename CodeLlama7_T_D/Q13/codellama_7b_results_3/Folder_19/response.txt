 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_second_largest_num` function:
```python
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    # Check if the input list is empty
    if len(my_list) == 0:
        return None

    # Find the second largest element in the list
    # using a variable to keep track of the largest element
    largest = my_list[0]
    second_largest = None

    for i in range(1, len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = my_list[i]

    # If the list has less than 3 elements, there is no second largest element
    if len(my_list) < 3:
        return None

    # Return the second largest element
    return second_largest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function will return `None`.
