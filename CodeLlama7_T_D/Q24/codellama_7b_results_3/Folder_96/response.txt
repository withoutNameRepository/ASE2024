This code defines a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 5 and 9, both inclusive. The function first checks if the input number is within the specified range, and if it is not, returns 0 immediately. If the input number is within the specified range, the function iterates through all positive divisors of the input number up to its square root, and appends each divisor that falls within the specified range (5-9) to a list called `divisors`. Finally, the function returns the sum of all divisors in the `divisors` list.
