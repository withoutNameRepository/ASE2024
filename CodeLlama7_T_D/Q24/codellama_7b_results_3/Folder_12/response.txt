 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_of_divisors_in_range` function in Python:
```
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    # Check if n is a positive integer
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")

    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0

    # Loop through all divisors of n between 13 and 62
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n))) + range(13, 63)):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum += i

    # Return the sum of all positive divisors of n that are between 13 and 62, inclusive
    return sum
```
This implementation uses a loop to iterate over all possible divisors of `n` between 13 and 62. It then checks each divisor using the modulo operator (`%`) to determine if it is a positive integer divisor of `n`. If it is, the function adds that divisor to the running sum `sum`. Finally, the function returns the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 13 and 62, inclusive.
