This code defines a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 1 and 8, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
The function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 1 to 8. For each number `i` in the range, the function checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, the function adds `i` to the sum. The final return value of the function is the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 1 and 8, both inclusive.
