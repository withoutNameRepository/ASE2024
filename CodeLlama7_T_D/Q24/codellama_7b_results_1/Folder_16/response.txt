 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_of_divisors_in_range` function in Python:
```
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 0

    # Initialize the sum to 0

    sum = 0

    # Iterate over the divisors of n

    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):

        # If i is a factor of n and it is between 228 and 846 (inclusive), add it to the sum

        if n % i == 0 and 228 <= i and i <= 846:
            sum += i

    return sum
```
