 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_of_divisors_in_range` function in Python:
```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    # Check if n is a positive integer
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")

    # Initialize the sum of divisors to 0
    sum_of_divisors = 0

    # Iterate over all divisors of n in the specified range
    for i in range(58, 91):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum_of_divisors += i

    # Return the sum of all positive divisors of n that are between 58 and 90, both inclusive
    return sum_of_divisors
```
This function takes a single argument `n`, which must be a positive integer. The function then calculates the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 58 and 90, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
Note that this implementation uses the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers between 58 and 90, both inclusive. The function then iterates over this sequence and calculates the sum of all positive divisors of `n` that are in the specified range.
