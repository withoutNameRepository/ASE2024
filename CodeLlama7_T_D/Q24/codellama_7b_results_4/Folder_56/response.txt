Explanation:
The function first checks if the input integer `n` is between 6 and 9, both inclusive. If it's not, it returns 0.
Next, we find all the positive divisors of `n` that are between 6 and 9, both inclusive. We do this by using a loop to iterate over all the numbers between 1 and the square root of `n`, and then checking if each number is a factor of `n`. If it is, we add it to our list of divisors.
Finally, we return the sum of all the positive divisors of `n` that are between 6 and 9, both inclusive. If there were no such divisors, the function would have returned 0 earlier.
