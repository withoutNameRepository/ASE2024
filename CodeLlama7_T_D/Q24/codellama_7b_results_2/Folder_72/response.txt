This code defines a function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument. The function returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 32 and 90, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
The function first checks if the input number is less than 32 or greater than 90. If this is the case, the function returns 0 immediately.
If the input number is within the specified range, the function initializes a variable `sum` to 0. Then, it iterates over the range of numbers between 32 and 90 (both inclusive), checking if each number is a divisor of the input number. If a divisor is found, its value is added to the `sum` variable.
Finally, the function returns the value of the `sum` variable.
