 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_of_divisors_in_range` function in Python:
```
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    # Check if n is positive and between 14 and 48 (both inclusive)
    if not (n > 0 and 14 <= n <= 48):
        return 0

    # Initialize the sum to 0

    sum = 0

    # Iterate over the divisors of n between 14 and 48 (both inclusive)

    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum += i

            if i * i < n:
                sum += n // i

    # Return the sum of the divisors of n between 14 and 48 (both inclusive)

    return sum
```
This function first checks if the input `n` is positive and between 14 and 48 (both inclusive). If it is not, the function returns 0.
Next, the function initializes the sum to 0.
Then, the function iterates over the divisors of `n` between 14 and 48 (both inclusive), using a for loop that goes from 1 to the square root of `n`. For each divisor `i`, the function checks if it divides `n`, and if so, adds `i` to the sum. If `i` is not the only divisor of `n`, the function also adds `n // i`, which is the number of times that `i` divides `n`.
Finally, the function returns the sum of all positive divisors of `n` between 14 and 48 (both inclusive).
