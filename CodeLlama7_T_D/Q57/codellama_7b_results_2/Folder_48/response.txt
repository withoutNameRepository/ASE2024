 Here's a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix, sum):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the submatrices
    submatrices = []

    # Iterate over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Calculate the sum of all integers in the current row
        row_sum = np.sum(matrix[i])

        # If the current row sum is equal to the desired sum, add the entire row as a submatrix
        if row_sum == sum:
            submatrices.append(matrix[i])

    # Return the list of all submatrices that have the desired sum
    return submatrices
```
This function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers, and `sum`, which is an integer representing the desired sum. The function returns a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals `-261`. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.
