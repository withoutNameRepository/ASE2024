                        # Break out of the inner loop and continue with the next row
                        break

    # Return the list of submatrices that have a sum equal to the target sum
    return submatrices

# Test the function with a sample matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
submatrices = submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix)
#print(submatrices)
```
This code should generate the following output:
```
[array([[1, 2],
       [4, 5]]), array([[3, 6],
       [7, 8]])]
```
