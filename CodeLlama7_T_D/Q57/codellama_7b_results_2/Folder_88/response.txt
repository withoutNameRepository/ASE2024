 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the submatrices
    submatrices = []

    # Loop over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Loop over each column of the matrix
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Create a copy of the original matrix
            submatrix = matrix.copy()

            # Remove all elements from the submatrix that are not in the current row or column
            submatrix = np.delete(submatrix, np.s_[i+1:], axis=0)
            submatrix = np.delete(submatrix, np.s_[:i], axis=0)
            submatrix = np.delete(submatrix, np.s_[j+1:], axis=1)
            submatrix = np.delete(submatrix, np.s_[:j], axis=1)

            # Check if the sum of all elements in the submatrix is equal to -64
            if np.sum(submatrix) == -64:
                # Add the submatrix to the list of submatrices
                submatrices.append(submatrix)

    # Return the list of submatrices that have a sum of all elements equal to -64
    return submatrices
```
This code uses nested loops to iterate over each row and column of the matrix, creating a copy of the original matrix for each iteration. It then removes all elements from the submatrix that are not in the current row or column using `np.delete`, checking if the sum of all elements in the submatrix is equal to -64. If it is, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices. Finally, the function returns the list of submatrices that have a sum of all elements equal to -64.
