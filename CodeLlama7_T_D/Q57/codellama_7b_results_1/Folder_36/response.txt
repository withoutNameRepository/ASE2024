This code uses NumPy to perform the operations on the matrix. It loops through each row and column of the matrix, creating a submatrix by selecting three rows and three columns at a time. The sum of all elements in the submatrix is calculated using the `np.sum` function, and it is compared to the desired value of -779. If the sum matches the desired value, the submatrix is appended to the list of submatrices.
The `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function takes a two-dimensional NumPy array as input, and it returns a list of all submatrices that have a sum of -779. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.
#To test the function with a sample matrix, we can create a NumPy array containing the values in the matrix, and pass it to the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function. The function will return a list of all submatrices that have a sum of -779, which we can print out to see the result.
#In this example, we create a NumPy array containing the values in the sample matrix, and pass it to the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function. The function returns a list containing one submatrix that has a sum of -779. We can print out the list to see the result.
