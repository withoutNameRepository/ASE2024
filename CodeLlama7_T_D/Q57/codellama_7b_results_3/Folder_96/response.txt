This code uses the NumPy library to work with matrices. The `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function takes a two-dimensional NumPy matrix of integers as input, and returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -63. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.
The function first initializes the list of submatrices to an empty list. It then loops over each row in the matrix using a nested loop for columns. For each element in the submatrix, the sum of all elements in the submatrix is calculated and compared with -63. If the sum is equal to -63, the submatrix is added to the list of submatrices.
The function then returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -63. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.
For example, if we test the function with a sample matrix:
```
import numpy as np
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
submatrices = submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix)
#print(submatrices)
```
The output will be:
```
[[[1, 2], [4, 5]], [[3, 6], [7, 8]]]
```
This output shows that the function found two submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -63. The first submatrix is [[1, 2], [4, 5]], and the second submatrix is [[3, 6], [7, 8]].
