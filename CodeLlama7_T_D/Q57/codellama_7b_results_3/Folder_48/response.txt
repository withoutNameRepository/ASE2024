 Here's a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the submatrices
    submatrices = []

    # Loop over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Loop over each column of the matrix
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the elements in the submatrix
            sum = 0

            # Loop over each element in the submatrix
            for k in range(i, i + 3):
                for l in range(j, j + 3):
                    # Add the element to the sum if it is within the boundaries of the matrix
                    if k < matrix.shape[0] and l < matrix.shape[1]:
                        sum += matrix[k][l]

            # If the sum of the elements in the submatrix equals -261, add the submatrix to the list of submatrices
            if sum == -261:
                submatrices.append(matrix[i:i + 3, j:j + 3])

    # Return the list of submatrices that have a sum of all elements equal to -261
    return submatrices
```
To test the function, you can use the following code:
```python
# Test the 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' function with a 3x3 matrix containing the numbers 0 through 8
matrix = np.array([[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]])
# Call the 'submatrix_with_particular_sum' function with the matrix as an argument
submatrices = submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix)
# Print the list of submatrices that have a sum of all elements equal to -261
#print(submatrices)
```
