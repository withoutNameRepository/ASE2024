This code defines a function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes as input a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 17. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.
The code first initializes an empty list to store the submatrices and then loops through each row of the matrix using nested for loops. For each row, it calculates the sum of the elements in that row. If the sum equals 17, the function extracts the submatrix from the matrix and adds it to the list of submatrices.
#The function returns the list of all submatrices that have a sum of 17. The code then tests the function with a sample matrix using the `print` statement at the end.
