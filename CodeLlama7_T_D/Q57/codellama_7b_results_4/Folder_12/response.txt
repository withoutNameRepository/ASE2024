            if submatrix_sum == -83:
                submatrices.append((i, j))
    # Return the list of submatrices that satisfy the condition
    return submatrices

# Test the function with a sample matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
# (modified) submatrices = submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix)
#print(submatrices)
```
This code will generate the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -83. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return an empty list.
