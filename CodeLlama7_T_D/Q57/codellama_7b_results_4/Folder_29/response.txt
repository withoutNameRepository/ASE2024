 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix, sum):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the submatrices
    submatrices = []

    # Iterate over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Get the current row of the matrix
        row = matrix[i]

        # Iterate over each column of the row
        for j in range(row.shape[0]):
            # Get the current element of the row and column
            element = row[j]

            # Check if the sum of all elements in the submatrix equals 84
            if sum == np.sum(element):
                # Add the submatrix to the list of submatrices
                submatrices.append(element)

    # Return the list of submatrices that satisfy the condition
    return submatrices
```
This function takes two arguments: a two-dimensional NumPy matrix `matrix` and an integer `sum`. It returns a list of all submatrices of `matrix` such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals `sum`. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.
