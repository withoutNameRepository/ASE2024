This code uses the NumPy library to work with matrices. The `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function takes a matrix as an argument and returns a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 382. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
The function first initializes an empty list to store the submatrices. It then loops over each row and column of the matrix using nested for loops. For each element in the matrix, the function finds the sum of all integers in the submatrix by adding up the elements in the rows above and below the current row, and subtracting the element at the current position. If the sum of all integers in the submatrix is equal to 382, the function adds the submatrix to the list of submatrices to be returned.
The function then returns the list of submatrices. The test case uses a random 5x6 matrix as input and verifies that the correct submatrices are found and returned.
