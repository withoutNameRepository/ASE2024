This code defines a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function should return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -779. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
Inside the function, we first initialize an empty list to store the submatrices. Then, we loop through each row of the matrix using two nested loops. In each iteration of the outer loop, we extract a 3x3 submatrix from the original matrix by slicing it with the indices `i:i+3` and `j:j+3`.
Next, we initialize a variable to store the sum of the elements in the current submatrix. We then loop through each element of the submatrix using two nested loops, and add its value to the running total.
Finally, if the sum of all integers in the current submatrix is equal to -779, we append the submatrix to the list of submatrices to be returned.
In the end, we return the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -779. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
