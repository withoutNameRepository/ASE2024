 Here's a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the submatrices
    submatrices = []

    # Loop over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Loop over each column of the matrix
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Initialize a variable to store the sum of the submatrix
            submatrix_sum = 0

            # Loop over each element of the submatrix
            for row in range(i, i + 3):
                for col in range(j, j + 3):
                    # Add the element to the submatrix sum
                    submatrix_sum += matrix[row][col]

            # Check if the submatrix sum is equal to the desired value (38)
            if submatrix_sum == 38:
                # Append the submatrix to the list of submatrices
                submatrices.append(submatrix_sum)

    # Return the list of all submatrices that have a sum of 38
    return submatrices
```
This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input, and returns a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 38. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.
