The code above defines a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 616. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
In this code, we first import the NumPy library and assign it to a variable called `np`. We then define a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes one argument which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 616. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
Inside the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function, we first initialize the list of submatrices to an empty list called `submatrices`. We then iterate over each row and column of the matrix using two nested for loops. Inside these for loops, we extract the submatrix with the particular sum by slicing the original matrix at the current row and column. We then check if the sum of all integers in the extracted submatrix is equal to 616, and if it is, we append the submatrix to the `submatrices` list.
#Finally, outside the function, we test the function with a sample matrix using the `print` statement.
