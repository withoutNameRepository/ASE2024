This code defines a function called `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input. The function returns the list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -97. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
The code uses nested loops to iterate over each row and column of the matrix. For each element in the matrix, the code calculates the sum of all integers in the submatrix starting from that element using NumPy's `sum()` method. The code then checks if the sum is equal to -97, and if it is, adds the submatrix to the output list.
#Finally, the code tests the function with a sample matrix and prints the output.
