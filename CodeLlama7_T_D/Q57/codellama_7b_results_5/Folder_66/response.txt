    return submatrices

# Test the function with a sample matrix
matrix = np.array([[10, 15, 3], [4, 6, 8]])
# (modified) submatrices = submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix)

```
This code will return a list of all the submatrices in the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 99. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return an empty list.
