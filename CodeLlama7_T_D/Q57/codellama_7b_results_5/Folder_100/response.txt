    # Initialize the list of submatrices
    submatrices = []

    # Loop through each row and column of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Extract the submatrix with the particular sum
            submatrix = matrix[i:, j:]
            if np.sum(submatrix) == 28:
                # Add the submatrix to the list of submatrices
                submatrices.append(submatrix)

    # Return the list of submatrices
    return submatrices

# Test the function with a sample matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
submatrices = submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix)
#print(submatrices)
```
This code will return a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 28. If no such submatrix is found, the function will return an empty list.
