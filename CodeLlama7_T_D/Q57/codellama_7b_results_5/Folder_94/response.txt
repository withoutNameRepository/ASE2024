 Here's a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_particular_sum` function in Python using NumPy:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the submatrices
    submatrices = []

    # Iterate over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Get the current row of the matrix
        row = matrix[i]

        # Iterate over each column of the row
        for j in range(row.size):
            # Get the current element of the row
            element = row[j]

            # Check if the sum of all elements in the submatrix equals 92
            if np.sum(element) == 92:
                # Add the submatrix to the list of submatrices
                submatrices.append(element)

    # Return the list of submatrices that have a sum of 92
    return submatrices
```
This function takes a two-dimensional NumPy matrix as input and returns a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals 92. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list.
