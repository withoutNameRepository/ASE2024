This code should produce the desired output for the given input matrix. The function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as its only argument, and returns a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -863. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
The code first imports the NumPy library with the alias `np`. It then defines a function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as its only argument, and returns a list of all submatrices of the given matrix such that the sum of all integers in each submatrix equals -863. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return an empty list.
The function first initializes an empty list called `submatrices` to store the output. It then loops over each row of the input matrix using a nested for loop. For each row, it loops over each column of the matrix and uses NumPy's sum function to find the sum of all integers in the submatrix starting at (i,j) and ending at the last element of the matrix.
It then checks if the submatrix sum is equal to -863 using the `==` operator. If it is, it adds the submatrix to the output list called `submatrices`.
Finally, the function returns the output list `submatrices`.
#The code then tests the function with a small example matrix and prints the output.
