This function takes a single argument, which is a list of integers. It then loops through the list and checks if each element is an odd integer using the modulo operator (%). If the element is an odd integer, it is added to the list of odd integers that is returned by the function. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
