Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910]

The correct answer was:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 127, 131, 137, 139, 151, 157, 173, 179, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 251, 257, 271, 277]

But the LLM code returned:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
