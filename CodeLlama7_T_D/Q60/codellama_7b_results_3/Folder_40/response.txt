 Here's a possible implementation of the `all_left_right_truncatable_prime` function:
```
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):
	# Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
	prime_numbers = []

	# Iterate through the numbers from 1 to x
	for i in range(1, x + 1):

		# Check if the number is a prime number
		if is_prime(i):

			# Check if the number is left-and-right-truncatable prime
			if is_left_right_truncatable_prime(i):

				# Add the number to the list of prime numbers
				prime_numbers.append(i)

	# Sort the list of prime numbers in descending order
	return sorted(prime_numbers, reverse=True)
```
This function takes a single argument `x`, which is a tuple of positive integers. It then uses a loop to iterate through all the numbers from 1 to `x`, and for each number checks if it is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If a number is prime, it then checks if it is left-and-right-truncatable prime using the `is_left_right_truncatable_prime` function. If the number is both prime and left-and-right-truncatable prime, it is added to the list of prime numbers. Finally, the list of prime numbers is sorted in descending order and returned as the output of the function.
