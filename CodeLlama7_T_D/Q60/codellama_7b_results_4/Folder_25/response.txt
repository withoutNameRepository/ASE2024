 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_left_right_truncatable_prime` function:
```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    prime_numbers = []

    # Check if x is a prime number and add it to the list if it is
    if is_prime(x):
        prime_numbers.append(x)

    # Iterate from 10 to x, checking if each number is a left-and-right-truncatable prime number
    for i in range(10, x + 1):
        if is_left_right_truncatable_prime(i):
            prime_numbers.append(i)

    # Return the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to x, sorted in ascending order
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
Here's an explanation of how the function works:
1. The function takes a tuple of positive integers as input, which represents the range of numbers to check for left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers.
2. The function initializes an empty list to store the prime numbers that are found.
3. The function checks if the number `x` is a prime number and adds it to the list if it is. This is done using the `is_prime` function, which checks whether a given integer is a prime number.
4. The function then iterates from 10 to `x + 1`, checking if each number is a left-and-right-truncatable prime number and adding it to the list if it is. This is done using the `is_left_right_truncatable_prime` function, which checks whether a given integer is a left-and-right-truncatable prime number by checking whether it contains no 0 and remains prime if the leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously successively removed down to a one- or two-digit prime.
5. The function then returns the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to `x`, sorted in ascending order.
