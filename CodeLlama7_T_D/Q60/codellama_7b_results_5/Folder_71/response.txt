Explanation:

This solution defines a function `all_left_right_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple as input and returns a list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to the number at index 22.
The function first extracts the value at index 22 from the tuple and stores it in the variable `x`. It then initializes an empty list that will be used to store the results.
Next, the function iterates through all integers between 1 and `x+1`, using a for loop. For each integer `i` in this range, the function checks if `i` is a left-and-right-truncatable prime number by calling the `is_left_right_truncatable_prime` function with `i` as an argument. If the result of this call is true, the integer `i` is added to the list of results.
Finally, the function returns the list of results in descending order by using the `sorted` function with the `reverse` parameter set to `True`.
The `is_left_right_truncatable_prime` function checks if a given integer `n` is a left-and-right-truncatable prime number. It does this by first checking if `n` is equal to 1 or 2, since these are the only two prime numbers that do not contain any 0 digits. If `n` is not equal to either of these values, the function checks if `n` is divisible by any integer between 2 and the square root of `n`, inclusive. If `n` is divisible by any such integer, it cannot be a left-and-right-truncatable prime number, so the function returns `False`. Otherwise, if no such integer exists, the function checks if `n` is a prime number by calling the `is_prime` function from the Python math library. If `n` is not a prime number, it cannot be a left-and-right-truncatable prime number either, so the function returns `False`. If `n` is a prime number, the function returns `True`.
Note that this solution uses the `math` library to check if a given integer is a prime number. It also uses the `sorted` and `reverse` parameters to sort the list of results in descending order.
