 Here is a function that satisfies the given text specification:
```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    # Find all prime numbers less than or equal to x
    primes = [p for p in range(2, x + 1) if all(p % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(p ** 0.5) + 1))]
    # Filter the list of prime numbers to include only those that are left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers
    return [p for p in primes if len(str(p)) > 1 and p % int(str(p)[1:]) == 0 and p % int(str(p)[:-1]))]
```
This function takes one argument, which is a tuple of positive integers. It returns the list of all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to the integer at index 52 in the specified range. The return list is sorted in descending order. If no left-and-right-truncatable prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
