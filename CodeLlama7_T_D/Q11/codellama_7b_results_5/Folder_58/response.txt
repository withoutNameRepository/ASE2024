def find_largest_num(my_list):

    for i in range(209, 557):

Explanation:
The function 'find_largest_num' takes one argument of type list and returns the largest element from index 209 to index 556, both inclusive.
We use a for loop to iterate over the range of indices [209, 557). We then check if the current element is greater than the largest element we have found so far (initialized to None). If it is, we update the largest element and continue iterating.
Once the loop has completed, we return the largest element from index 209 to index 556, both inclusive.
