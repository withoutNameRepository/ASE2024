 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_largest_num` function:
```
def find_largest_num(my_list):
    largest_num = None
    for i in range(639, 976):
        if largest_num == None or my_list[i] > largest_num:
            largest_num = my_list[i]
    return largest_num
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest element from index 639 to index 975, both inclusive. The function first initializes the `largest_num` variable to None, indicating that no number has been found yet. Then it iterates over the elements in the specified range using a for loop. For each element in the range, the function checks whether the current largest number is greater than the current element. If so, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function sets the `largest_num` variable to the current element. After iterating over all the elements in the specified range, the function returns the value of the `largest_num` variable, which will be the largest number found in the specified range.
