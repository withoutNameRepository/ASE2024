 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_largest_num` function:
```
def find_largest_num(numbers):
    largest = None
    for i in range(533, 605 + 1):
        if largest is None or numbers[i] > largest:
            largest = numbers[i]
    return largest
```
This function takes a list of numbers as its argument, and it returns the largest element from index 533 to index 605, both inclusive.
