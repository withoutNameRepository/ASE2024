 ```
def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return max(my_list[4:5])
```
This function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of numbers. The function then uses the built-in `max()` function to find the largest element in the specified range of indices. In this case, the range of indices is from 4 to 4 (both inclusive), so the function will return the largest element from the fifth position in the list.
