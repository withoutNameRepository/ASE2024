 ```
def find_largest_num(numbers):
return max(numbers[62:64])
```
Explanation:
The function takes a list of numbers as its argument. It then uses the built-in `max()` function to find the largest element in the specified range (indexes 62 to 63, both inclusive). The returned value is the largest element from the specified range.
