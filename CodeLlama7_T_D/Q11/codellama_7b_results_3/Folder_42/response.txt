 Here is a Python function that meets the specified criteria:
```
def find_largest_num(numbers):
    largest = None

    for i in range(29, 80):

        if largest is None or numbers[i] > largest:
            largest = numbers[i]

    return largest
```
This function takes a list of numbers as its argument and returns the largest element from index 29 to index 79, both inclusive.
