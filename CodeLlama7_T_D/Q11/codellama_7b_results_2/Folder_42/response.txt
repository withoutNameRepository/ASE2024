 ```
def find_largest_num(numbers):
    return max(numbers[29:79+1])
```
This function takes a single argument `numbers`, which is a list of numbers. It then uses the built-in `max()` function to find the largest element from index 29 to index 79, both inclusive. The `+1` at the end of the slice is necessary because Python slice indices are exclusive of the last element.
