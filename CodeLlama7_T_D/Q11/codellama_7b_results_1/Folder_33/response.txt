def find_largest_num(my_list):
return max(my_list[667:774+1])
```
Explanation:

The `find_largest_num` function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of numbers. The function returns the largest element from index 667 to index 774, both inclusive.
To achieve this, we use the built-in Python function `max`. We pass it a slice of the input list, `my_list[667:774+1]`, which contains all elements from index 667 to index 774, both inclusive. The `+1` in the slice is because we want to include element at index 774 in the slice as well.
Once we have the slice, we use the built-in `max` function to find the largest element in the slice. We return this largest element as the final result of the function.
