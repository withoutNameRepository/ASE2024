 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_largest_num` function:
```
def find_largest_num(my_list):
    largest = None
    for i in range(68, 87):
        if largest is None or my_list[i] > largest:
            largest = my_list[i]
    return largest
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest element from indices 68 to 86, both inclusive.
