 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[13]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 13th smallest number from index 14 to index 96, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function, then it selects the 13th element (index 13) from the sorted list.
Note that this solution assumes that the input list is a valid Python list and contains at least 96 elements. If the list is not valid or does not contain enough elements, the function will raise an error.
