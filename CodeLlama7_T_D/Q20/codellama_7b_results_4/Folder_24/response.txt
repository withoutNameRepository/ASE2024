def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[43:81][5]]
```
Explanation:

The function `find_n_th_smallest_num` takes a list of distinct numbers as input. It sorts the list using the built-in `sorted()` function and then extracts the 6th smallest number from index 43 to index 80, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the 6th smallest number after the extraction process.
