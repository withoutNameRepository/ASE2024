 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[12]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 13th smallest number from index 0 to index 12, both inclusive.
Here's an explanation of how this code works:
* The `sorted()` function is used to sort the input list in ascending order.
* The `[12]` notation is used to extract the 13th element of the sorted list.
* Since the input list contains distinct numbers, the sorted list will also contain distinct numbers, and therefore the 13th smallest number will be returned.
