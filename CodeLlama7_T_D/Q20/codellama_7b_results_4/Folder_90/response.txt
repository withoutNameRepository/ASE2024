def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
# Extract the list of numbers between index 366 and index 578, both inclusive

This function takes a single argument `numbers`, which is a list of distinct numbers. It then extracts a subset of the original list, containing all the numbers between index 366 and index 578, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the 17th smallest number from this subset using the sorted() function.
