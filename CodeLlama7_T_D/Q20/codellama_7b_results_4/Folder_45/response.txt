 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[15]
```
Here's an explanation of the code:
* `def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list)` defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes one argument, `my_list`, which is a list of distinct numbers.
* `return sorted(my_list)[15]` returns the 16th smallest number from the input list. The `sorted()` function sorts the input list in ascending order, and then the `[15]` indexing operation retrieves the 16th element from the sorted list.
Note that this code assumes that the input list is a list of distinct numbers, and that there are at least 16 elements in the list. If the input list contains duplicates or fewer than 16 elements, the function will raise an error.
