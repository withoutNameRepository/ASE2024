 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[19]
```
Explanation:
The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 19th smallest number from index 19 to index 190, both inclusive.
The function first sorts the list of numbers using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the list is sorted in ascending order.
Next, the function accesses the 19th element of the sorted list using square brackets (`[]`). This element will contain the 19th smallest number from index 19 to index 190, both inclusive.
Finally, the function returns the 19th smallest number by returning the value stored in the 19th element of the sorted list.
