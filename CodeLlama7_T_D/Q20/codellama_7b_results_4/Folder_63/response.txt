def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[4]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the fifth smallest number from index 33 to index 39, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function. Then it returns the fifth element of the sorted list, which corresponds to the fifth smallest number in the original unsorted list.
