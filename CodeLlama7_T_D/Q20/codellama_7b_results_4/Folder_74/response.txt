 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[16]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input, and returns the 17th smallest number from index 12 to index 90, both inclusive.
To find the nth smallest number, we first sort the list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function. This creates a new sorted list based on the original list.
Next, we access the 16th element of this sorted list, which corresponds to the 17th smallest number from index 12 to index 90, both inclusive.
Note that the indices of the elements in the sorted list are different from the indices of the elements in the original list. The `sorted()` function creates a new list with its own indices, and we access these indices to obtain the desired result.
