def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Find the index of the 7th smallest number
    index_of_seventh_smallest = (len(my_list) - 1) // 6

```
This code defines a function `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 7th smallest number from index 23 to index 45, both inclusive. The function first finds the index of the 7th smallest number in the list using integer division. Then it returns the corresponding element from the list.
