 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Get the index of the nth smallest number
    nth_smallest_index = (len(my_list) // 2) - 1
    # Return the nth smallest number
    return my_list[nth_smallest_index]
```
Here is an explanation of how this code works:
1. The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 23 to index 57, both inclusive.
2. The first line of the function sorts the input list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. This is necessary because we want to find the nth smallest number in the sorted list.
3. The second line of the function calculates the index of the nth smallest number in the sorted list using the `(len(my_list) // 2) - 1` formula. This formula gives us the middle element of the list, and then subtracts 1 to get the previous element, which is the (n-1)th smallest number.
4. The third line of the function returns the nth smallest number using the `return` statement.
In summary, this code sorts the input list in ascending order, calculates the index of the nth smallest number in the sorted list, and then returns the nth smallest number.
