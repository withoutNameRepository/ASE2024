 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_n_th_smallest_num` function:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the 8th smallest number from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive
    return my_list[7]
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the input list is a list of distinct numbers. If the input list contains duplicates, then the function may not work correctly.
