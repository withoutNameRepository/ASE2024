def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[13]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 14th smallest number from index 32 to index 61, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function. Then it returns the 14th element of the sorted list by indexing into it with the square bracket notation.
