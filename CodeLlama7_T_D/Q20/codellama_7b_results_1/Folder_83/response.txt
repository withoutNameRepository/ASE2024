 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_n_th_smallest_num` function in Python:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the 15th smallest number from index 30 to index 300, both inclusive
    return my_list[29:301][14]]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 15th smallest number from index 30 to index 300, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, it uses slicing to extract the sublist of numbers starting from index 30 and ending at index 300, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the 15th smallest number from this sublist using the indexing operator `[14]`.
