def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[6]
```
Note: This function assumes that the input list is a list of distinct numbers, and returns the 7th smallest number from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive. If the input list contains duplicates, the function may not work correctly.
