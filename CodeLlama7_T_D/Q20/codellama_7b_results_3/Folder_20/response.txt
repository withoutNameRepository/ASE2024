def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    # sort the list of numbers

```
This code defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 12th smallest number from index 25 to index 64, both inclusive.
The code first sorts the list of numbers using the built-in `sorted()` function. This ensures that the numbers are in ascending order, which allows us to easily identify the 12th smallest number.
Next, we extract a slice from the sorted list using the slicing notation. We specify the range of indices as `[25:65]`, which includes all elements between and including indices 25 and 64 (inclusive).
Finally, we return the 12th element of this slice, which is the 12th smallest number from index 25 to index 64, both inclusive.
