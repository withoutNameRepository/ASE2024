def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[69:85]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 7th smallest number from index 69 to index 85, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function. Then it slices the sorted list from index 69 to index 85, both inclusive, and returns the resulting sublist.
