 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_n_th_smallest_num` function in Python:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the 10th smallest number from index 52 to index 88, both inclusive
    return my_list[52:89].sort()
```
The `find_n_th_smallest_num` function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 10th smallest number from index 52 to index 88, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list in ascending order using the built-in `sort()` method. Then, it slices the sorted list from indices 52 to 89 (both inclusive), and sorts this slice again using the `sort()` method. Finally, it returns the 10th smallest number from this slice.
