def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[36:93]
```
Explanation:

The `find_n_th_smallest_num` function takes a list of distinct numbers as input. The function first sorts the list using the `sorted()` function and then extracts the 4th smallest number from index 36 to index 93, both inclusive.
Note that this function assumes that the input list is already sorted in ascending order. If the list is not already sorted, you may need to add an additional step to sort the list before extracting the 4th smallest number.
