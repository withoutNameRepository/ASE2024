 Here is a possible implementation of the function:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the n-th smallest number from the sorted list
    return my_list[6]
```
This code defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the 7th smallest number from the sorted list.
