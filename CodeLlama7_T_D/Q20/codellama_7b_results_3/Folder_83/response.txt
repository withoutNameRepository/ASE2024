 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_n_th_smallest_num` function in Python:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    # Sort the list of numbers in ascending order
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)

    # Get the 15th smallest number from index 30 to index 300, both inclusive
    nth_smallest_number = sorted_numbers[29:300][14]]
    return nth_smallest_number
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input, sorts the list in ascending order using the built-in `sorted` function, and then uses indexing to extract the 15th smallest number from index 30 to index 300, both inclusive. The resulting number is returned by the function.
