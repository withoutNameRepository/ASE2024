def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[48:72].sort()[0]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 9th smallest number from index 51 to index 71, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list using the `sorted()` function. Then, it slices the sorted list from index 51 to index 72 and gets the first element of the slice using the `[0]` index. This is the 9th smallest number in the slice.
