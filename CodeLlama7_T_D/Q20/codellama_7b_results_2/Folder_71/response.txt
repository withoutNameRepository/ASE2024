def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Get the index of the 4th smallest number from index 56 to index 70, both inclusive

    return my_list[nth_index]
```
This code defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 56 to index 70, both inclusive.
The code first sorts the input list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. This ensures that all the numbers in the list are sorted in ascending order.
Next, the code calculates the index of the 4th smallest number from index 56 to index 70, both inclusive, by dividing the sum of the indices by 2. This is done using the `//` operator, which performs integer division and returns the result as an integer.
Finally, the code returns the element at the calculated index in the sorted list.
Note that this code assumes that the input list contains at least 81 elements (70 - 56 + 1), or else it will raise an error when trying to access an element at an invalid index.
