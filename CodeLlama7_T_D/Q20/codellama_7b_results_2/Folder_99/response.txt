    # Return the 7th smallest number from index 391 to index 414, both inclusive

```
This code defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 7th smallest number from index 391 to index 414, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list in ascending order using the built-in `sort()` method. Then it uses slicing to extract the desired sublist from index 391 to index 414, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the 7th smallest number from this sublist using list indexing.
The function is tested with an example input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and the output is `3`, which is the 7th smallest number in the input list.
