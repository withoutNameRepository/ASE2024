def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[4]
```
Explanation:

The function `find_n_th_smallest_num` takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 5th smallest number from index 0 to index 4, both inclusive.
The function first sorts the input list using the built-in `sorted()` function. Then it selects the 5th element from the sorted list by indexing into it with `[4]`.
The return statement then returns this selected 5th smallest number to the caller of the function.
