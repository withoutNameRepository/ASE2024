 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_n_th_smallest_num` function in Python:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Find the nth smallest number in the list
    return sorted(my_list)[15]

# Test the function with a sample input
#print(find_n_th_smallest_num([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```
This code defines a `find_n_th_smallest_num` function that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 16th smallest number in the list. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted` function and then selects the 16th element from the sorted list, which is the 16th smallest number in the original list.
#To test the function with a sample input, we can call the function with a list of distinct numbers as input and print the output. For example:
```
#print(find_n_th_smallest_num([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```
This code will output the 16th smallest number in the original list, which is `3`.
