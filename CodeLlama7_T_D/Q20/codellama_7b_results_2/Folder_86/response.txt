def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[85:99+1]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 7th smallest number from index 85 to index 99, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function, and then slices the sorted list from index 85 to index 99+1 (inclusive). The returned value is a list of 7 numbers, where each number represents one of the smallest elements in the original list.
