 Here is a Python function that implements the given text specification:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the n-th smallest number from index n to index m, both inclusive
    return my_list[3:9]
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list` which is a list of distinct numbers. It then sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method and returns the 4th smallest number from index 4 to index 8, both inclusive using slicing syntax.
