 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[12]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 12th smallest number from index 58 to index 93, both inclusive.
Firstly, we sort the given list using the built-in `sorted()` function. This will arrange the elements in ascending order.
Next, we access the 12th element of the sorted list by using square brackets (`[]`) and indexing from 0.
Finally, we return the 12th smallest number from index 58 to index 93, both inclusive.
