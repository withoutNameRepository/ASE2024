def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[11]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 12th smallest number from index 25 to index 64, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function. Then it uses slicing to extract the subset of the sorted list that contains the numbers between index 25 and 64, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the 12th smallest number from this subset.
