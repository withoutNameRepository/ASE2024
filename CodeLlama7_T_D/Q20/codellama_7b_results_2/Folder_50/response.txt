 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[46:83+1]
```
Note that the `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and then the slicing operator (`[:]`) is used to extract the desired sublist from index 46 to index 83 (both inclusive). The resulting sublist will contain the 15th smallest number from the original list.
