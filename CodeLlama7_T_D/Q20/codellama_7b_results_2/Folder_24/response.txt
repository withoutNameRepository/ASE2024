def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[42:80][-1]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 6th smallest number from index 43 to index 80, both inclusive.
The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function. This creates a new sorted list based on the original input list.
Next, the function slices the sorted list using the `[42:80]` notation. This creates a new list that contains the 43rd to 79th elements of the sorted list.
Finally, the function selects the last element of this slice using the `[-1]` notation. This returns the 6th smallest number from index 43 to index 80, both inclusive.
