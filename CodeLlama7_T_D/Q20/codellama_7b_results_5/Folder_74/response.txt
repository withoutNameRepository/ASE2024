 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the 17th smallest number from index 12 to index 90, both inclusive
    return my_list[12:90][16]]
```
This code defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input. The function sorts the list in ascending order and then returns the 17th smallest number from index 12 to index 90, both inclusive.
