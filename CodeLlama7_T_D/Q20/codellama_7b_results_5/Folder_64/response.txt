 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_n_th_smallest_num` function in Python:
```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the 7th smallest number from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive
    return my_list[6]
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is a list of distinct numbers. The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then, it returns the 7th smallest number from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive.
