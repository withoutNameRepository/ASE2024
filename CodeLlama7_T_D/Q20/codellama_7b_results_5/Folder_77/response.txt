def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()
    # Return the 9th smallest number from index 106 to index 254, both inclusive
    return my_list[106:254+1].index(my_list[106:254+1][-1]) + 106
```
This code defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 9th smallest number from index 106 to index 254, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method. Then it uses slicing to extract the elements from index 106 to index 254 (both inclusive) and returns the index of the 9th smallest number using the `index()` method. Finally, it adds 106 to the returned index to obtain the actual index of the 9th smallest number in the original list.
