def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[13]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 14th smallest number from index 16 to index 71, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function and then uses indexing to extract the 14th smallest number from the sorted list.
