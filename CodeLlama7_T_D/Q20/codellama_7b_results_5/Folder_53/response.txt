 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[19]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 19th smallest number from index 19 to index 190, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the built-in `sorted` function. Then it extracts the 19th element from the sorted list using indexing.
For example, if we call the function with an input list of `[20, 35, 8, 22, 9, 44, 15, 10]`, the output will be `15`. This is because the sorted list is `[8, 10, 15, 20, 22, 35, 44, 9]]`, and the 19th element from index 19 to index 190, both inclusive, is `15`.
