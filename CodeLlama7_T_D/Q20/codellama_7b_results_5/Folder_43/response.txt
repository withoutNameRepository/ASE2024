def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Find the n-th smallest number in the list
    n = 16
    return sorted(my_list)[n-1]
```
This code defines a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the 16th smallest number from index 28 to index 64, both inclusive.
The function first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` function. Then it returns the n-th smallest number in the sorted list, where n is equal to 16 in this case.
