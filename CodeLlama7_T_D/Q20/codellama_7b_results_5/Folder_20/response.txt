def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[12]
```
Explanation:

The function `find_n_th_smallest_num` takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 12th smallest number from index 25 to index 64, both inclusive.
To achieve this, we first sort the input list using the built-in `sorted()` function. This will put all the elements in the input list in ascending order.
Next, we extract the 12th element from the sorted list using indexing. Since the sorting puts the smallest number at index 0, the 12th smallest number from index 25 to index 64 would be at index 36 (25 + 12). Therefore, we return `sorted(my_list)[36]`.
This function returns the 12th smallest number from index 25 to index 64, both inclusive.
