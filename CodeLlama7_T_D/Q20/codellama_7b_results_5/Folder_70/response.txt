def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[25:90][3]]```
In this solution, we define a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input. The function first sorts the input list using the built-in `sorted()` function. Then, it returns the 4th smallest number from index 26 to index 90, both inclusive, by indexing into the sorted list.
Here is an example usage of this function:
```
# Test the function with a sample list of numbers
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
#print(find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list)) # Output: 4```
