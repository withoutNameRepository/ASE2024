 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[15]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 15th smallest number from index 30 to index 300, both inclusive.
The function first sorts the list using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the elements in the list are in ascending order.
Next, the function uses indexing to select the 15th element from the sorted list. Since Python indexes start at 0, this corresponds to the 16th element (index 15) in the list.
Finally, the function returns the selected element as the output of the function.
