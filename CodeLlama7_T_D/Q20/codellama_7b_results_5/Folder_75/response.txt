 ```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[17:83][5]]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the sixth smallest number from index 18 to index 82, both inclusive.
Here's how the function works:
1. `sorted(my_list)` sorts the input list in ascending order.
2. `[17:83]` extracts a slice of the sorted list starting from index 17 (i.e., the 18th element) and ending at index 83 (i.e., the 84th element).
3. `[5]` selects the sixth smallest number from the extracted slice.

Note that the input list must be a list of distinct numbers for this function to work correctly.
