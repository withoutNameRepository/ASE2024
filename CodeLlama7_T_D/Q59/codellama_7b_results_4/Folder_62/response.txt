This code defines a function `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. The function returns a list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than the integer at index 70 in the given tuple. The returned list is sorted in ascending order.
The code first defines a variable `x` to store the integer at index 70 in the given tuple. Then, it initializes an empty list named `list`.
The for loop iterates from 2 to `x`, which is the largest prime number less than `x`. For each value of `i`, the code checks if it is a prime number using the `is_prime` function and if it is a left-truncatable prime number using the `left_truncatable_prime` function. If both conditions are true, then the integer `i` is appended to the list `list`.
Finally, the code returns the sorted list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`.
