 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_left_truncatable_prime` function:
```
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tuple):
    x = tuple[37]
    left_truncatable_primes = []
    for i in range(2, x):
        if is_prime(i) and left_truncatable_prime(i, x):
            left_truncatable_primes.append(i)
    return sorted(left_truncatable_primes, reverse=True)
```
This function takes a tuple of positive integers as input. It then extracts the integer at index 37 from the tuple and uses it to determine the maximum value for which left-truncatable prime numbers should be returned.
The function first initializes an empty list to store all left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`. It then iterates through all numbers between 2 and `x`, using the `is_prime` function from the `math` module to check if each number is prime, and the `left_truncatable_prime` function defined in the previous exercise to check if each prime number is left-truncatable. If a prime number is both prime and left-truncatable, it is added to the list of left-truncatable prime numbers.
Once all left-truncatable prime numbers have been identified, the function returns a sorted list of these numbers in descending order.
