 Here's a possible implementation of the `all_left_truncatable_prime` function in Python:
```
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tuple):
    x = tuple[630]
    prime_numbers = []

    for i in range(2, x):
        if is_prime(i):
            if is_left_truncatable_prime(i):
                prime_numbers.append(i)

    return sorted(prime_numbers, reverse=True)
```
In this implementation, the `all_left_truncatable_prime` function takes a tuple of positive integers as input. The function then extracts the 630th element from the tuple and stores it in the variable `x`.
The function initializes an empty list called `prime_numbers` to store all the left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`. It then iterates over the range of numbers from 2 to `x`, and for each number `i`, it checks if `i` is a prime number using the built-in Python function `is_prime`. If `i` is not a prime number, the function skips it.
If `i` is a prime number, the function checks if it is also a left-truncatable prime number by removing one digit at a time from its leftmost digits until it reaches the empty string. The function uses the built-in Python function `str.rstrip()` to remove the rightmost digit of the string representation of `i`, and it repeats this process until it reaches the empty string. If any of the resulting numbers after each removal is not a prime number, then the original number `i` is not a left-truncatable prime number, and the function skips to the next iteration.
If `i` is a left-truncatable prime number, the function adds it to the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`, and then sorts this list in descending order using the built-in Python function `sorted()`. The sorted list is then returned by the `all_left_truncatable_prime` function.
