The function `all_left_truncatable_prime` takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. It then iterates over the tuple to find all left-truncatable prime numbers less than each integer in the tuple. The resulting list of prime numbers is sorted in descending order and returned by the function.
The function `is_prime` is defined separately to check if a number is a prime number. It works by iterating from 2 to n-1 and checking if any factor is found using the modulo operator. If no factor is found, then the number is considered prime and the function returns True. Otherwise, the function returns False.
