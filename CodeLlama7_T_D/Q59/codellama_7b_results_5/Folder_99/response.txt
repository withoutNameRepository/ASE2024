 Here's a possible implementation of the `all_left_truncatable_prime` function in Python:
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    prime_numbers = []

    # Loop through the range of numbers from 1 to x-1
    for i in range(1, x-1):
        # Check if the number is a prime number
        if is_prime(i):
            # If the number is a prime number, check if it is left-truncatable prime
            if is_left_truncatable_prime(i):
                # Add the left-truncatable prime number to the list of prime numbers
                prime_numbers.append(i)

    # Sort the list of prime numbers in ascending order
    prime_numbers.sort()

    return prime_numbers

# Define a function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    # Check if n is less than 2
    if n < 2:
        return False

    # Loop through the range of numbers from 2 to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)))):
        # Check if n is divisible by i
        if n % i == 0:
            # If n is divisible by i, return False
            return False

    # If n is not divisible by any number between 2 and sqrt(n), return True
    return True

# Define a function to check if a number is left-truncatable prime
def is_left_truncatable_prime(n):
    # Check if n is less than 10
    if n < 10:
        return False

    # Loop through the range of numbers from 1 to len(str(n)))-1
    for i in range(1, len(str(n)))):
        # Get the substring of the number starting at position i and ending at the end of the string
        substring = str(n)[i:]

        # Check if the substring is a prime number
        if is_prime(int(substring)):
            # If the substring is a prime number, return True
            return True

    # If n is not divisible by any number between 2 and sqrt(n), return False
    return False
```
This code defines three functions: `all_left_truncatable_prime`, `is_prime`, and `is_left_truncatable_prime`. The `all_left_truncatable_prime` function takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. It then loops through the range of numbers from 1 to x-1, where x is the integer at index 758 in the tuple. For each number i in this range, it first checks if i is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If i is not divisible by any number between 2 and sqrt(i), then it returns False. If i is a prime number and it is also left-truncatable prime (i.e., if the leading leftmost digit is successively removed, then all resulting numbers are prime), then it adds the number to the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x. The function then sorts the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers in ascending order and returns the sorted list.
