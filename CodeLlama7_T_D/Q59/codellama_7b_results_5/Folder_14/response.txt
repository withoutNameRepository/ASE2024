    list = []
    for i in range(2, x):
        if is_prime(i) and is_left_truncatable_prime(i, x)):

```
This code defines a function called `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. It then extracts the integer at index 78 in the tuple and uses it to define a variable called `x`. The function then initializes an empty list called `list`.
The code then iterates over the range of numbers from 2 to `x`, checking each number for primality using the built-in `is_prime` method. If a number is prime, the code checks whether it is left-truncatable prime by repeatedly removing the leading leftmost digit and verifying that the resulting number is prime.
If a number is left-truncatable prime, the code appends it to the `list`. The `list` is then sorted in descending order using the built-in `sorted` method with the `reverse=True` argument.
Finally, the function returns the sorted `list`.
