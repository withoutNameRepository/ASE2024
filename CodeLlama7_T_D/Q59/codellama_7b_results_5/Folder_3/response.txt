This function takes a tuple of positive integers as input. It then extracts the 100th element of the tuple, which we will call x.
The function uses a for loop to iterate over all prime numbers less than x. For each prime number p, it checks if p is a left-truncatable prime number by first checking if it is a prime number (using the `is_prime` function), and then checking if removing the leading leftmost digit successively from p results in all resulting numbers being prime (using the `is_left_truncatable_prime` function). If both checks are true, then p is added to the list of left-truncatable prime numbers.
Finally, the function returns the sorted list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x.
