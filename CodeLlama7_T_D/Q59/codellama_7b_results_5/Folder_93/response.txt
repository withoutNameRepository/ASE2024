 Here is a possible implementation of the function `all_left_truncatable_prime` in Python:
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tuple_of_positive_integers):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    prime_numbers = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the tuple
    for element in tuple_of_positive_integers:
        # If the current element is a prime number
        if is_prime(element):
            # Add it to the list of prime numbers
            prime_numbers.append(element)

    # Return the sorted list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the input tuple contains only positive integers, and it does not check for this condition. It also assumes that there are no duplicate elements in the input tuple.
