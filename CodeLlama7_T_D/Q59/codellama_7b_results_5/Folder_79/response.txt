This code defines a function called `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers. The function returns the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x, where x is the integer at index 91 in the tuple. The return list is sorted in ascending order.
The function first defines `x` as the integer at index 91 in the tuple. Then it creates an empty list to store all left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`.
Next, the function iterates over the range of prime numbers less than `x`, and checks if each number is a prime number and if it is a left-truncatable prime number. If a number is a left-truncatable prime number, then it is added to the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`.
Finally, the function returns the sorted list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`.
