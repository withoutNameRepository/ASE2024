 Here's a possible implementation of the `all_left_truncatable_prime` function:
```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers
    prime_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through the numbers from 1 to x
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        # If the current number is a prime number and it is left-truncatable prime number, then add it to the list of prime numbers
        if is_prime(i) and is_left_truncatable_prime(i):
            prime_numbers.append(i)
    # Sort the list of prime numbers in descending order
    prime_numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    # Return the list of prime numbers
    return prime_numbers
```
Here is an explanation of how this function works:
1. The function takes a tuple of positive integers as input, and returns a list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x, sorted in descending order.
2. The function initializes an empty list to store the prime numbers.
3. The function iterates through the numbers from 1 to x using a for loop. For each number i, the function checks if it is a prime number and if it is a left-truncatable prime number. If both conditions are true, then the number is added to the list of prime numbers.
4. The function sorts the list of prime numbers in descending order using the `sort` method.
5. The function returns the list of prime numbers.
