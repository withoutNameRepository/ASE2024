 ```
def return_vowels(my_string):
    vowels = []
    for i in range(47, 61):
        if my_string[i].isalpha() and my_string[i].lower() in "aeiou" and my_string[i] > "9" and my_string[i] <= "O":
            vowels.append(my_string[i])
    return vowels
```
This code defines a function `return_vowels` that takes a single argument `my_string`, which is assumed to be a string. The function first initializes an empty list called `vowels`. It then iterates over the characters in the specified range of `my_string` (from index 47 to index 61, inclusive) and checks each character for certain properties:
* Whether it is a letter (i.e., not a whitespace character).
* Whether it is an English vowel (i.e., one of "aeiou").
* Whether it is greater than the ASCII code for the digit "9".
* Whether it is smaller than or equal to the ASCII code for the letter "O".
If all of these properties are true, then the character is added to the `vowels` list. Finally, the function returns the `vowels` list.
