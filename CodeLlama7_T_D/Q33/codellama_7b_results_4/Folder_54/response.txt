This code defines a function called `return_vowels` that takes a single argument of type `str`. The function first creates a list of all vowel letters in the English language, which is stored in the variable `vowels`.
The function then defines two index values that mark the beginning and end of the range of characters to be searched. In this case, the start index is 23 and the end index is 85.
The function then iterates through each character in the given string within the specified range, using a for loop. For each character, the function checks if it is an alphabetical character (i.e., not a space or other non-alphabetical character) using the `isalpha()` method. If the character is alphabetical, the function checks if it is a vowel by checking if its value is in the list of vowels created earlier. The function then checks if the character is greater than the letter "W" and smaller than or equal to the letter "v".
If all these conditions are true for a given character, the function adds that character to the list `result`. After the for loop is complete, the function returns the list `result`.
The function can be tested with a sample string by calling it and passing in the desired string as an argument. For example, if we pass in the string "Hello World!", the function will return the vowel letters "e" and "o".
