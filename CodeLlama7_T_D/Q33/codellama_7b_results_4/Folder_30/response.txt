 ```
def return_vowels(my_string):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the vowels
    vowels = []
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in my_string:
        # Check if the character is a vowel and if it is greater than M and smaller than or equal to W
        if char.isalpha() and (char > 'M' and char <= 'W'):
            # Add the vowel to the list
            vowels.append(char)
    # Return the list of vowels
    return vowels
```
This code uses a combination of string methods (`isalpha()` and `>`) and list methods (`append()`) to solve the problem.
The first line of the function, `vowels = []`, initializes an empty list to store the vowels.
The second line of the function, `for char in my_string:`, loops through each character in the string.
Inside the loop, the code uses the `isalpha()` method to check if the current character is a letter or not. If it is a letter, the code checks if it is greater than the character 'M' and smaller than or equal to the character 'W'. If this condition is true, the code adds the vowel to the list of vowels using the `append()` method.
Once all the characters in the string have been checked, the function returns the list of vowels using the `return` statement.
