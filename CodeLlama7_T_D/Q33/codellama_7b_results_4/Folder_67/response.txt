This code defines a function called `return_vowels` that takes one argument, a string. The function first initializes an empty list called `vowels`. It then iterates through the characters in the specified range (inclusive of index 21 and exclusive of index 59) of the input string. For each character, it checks if it is an alpha character (i.e., a letter or a number), whether it is greater than the forward slash character ('/') and smaller than or equal to the lowercase 'a' character, and whether it is a vowel. If all these conditions are true, the function appends the current character to the `vowels` list. Finally, the function returns the `vowels` list.
