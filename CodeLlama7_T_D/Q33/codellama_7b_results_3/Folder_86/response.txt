Explanation:

The function `return_vowels` takes a string as an argument and returns a list of all the vowel letters in the specified range, which are greater than the given character + and smaller than or equal to the given character o. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

To achieve this, we first define an empty list called `vowels`. Then we iterate over the indices of the given string from 273 to 275 using a for loop.

For each index i, we check if the character at that index is an alphabet and either equal to 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u'. If it satisfies these conditions, we append the character to the `vowels` list.

Finally, we return the `vowels` list.
