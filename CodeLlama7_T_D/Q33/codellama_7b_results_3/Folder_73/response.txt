 ```
def return_vowels(string):
    vowels = []
    for char in string[47:89]:
        if char.isalpha() and char.lower() in "aeiou":
            vowels.append(char)
    return vowels
```
Note that this function assumes that the input string is at least 50 characters long, as it is checking the vowel characters between index 47 (inclusive) and index 89 (exclusive). If the input string is shorter than 50 characters, the function will still return an empty list.
