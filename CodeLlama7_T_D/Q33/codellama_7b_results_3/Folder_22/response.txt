 ```
def return_vowels(my_string):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the vowels
    vowels = []
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in my_string:
        # Check if the character is a vowel
        if char in "aeiou":
            # Add the character to the list of vowels
            vowels.append(char)
    return vowels
```
This code defines a function called `return_vowels` that takes a string as its argument and returns a list containing all the vowel characters in the given string, which are greater than character K and smaller than or equal to character z.
