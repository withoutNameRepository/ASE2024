This function first initializes an empty list called `vowels`. Then it iterates through the characters in the given string from index 15 to index 86 (exclusive). For each character, it checks if it is an alphabetical character and if it is a vowel. If the character is a vowel and its ASCII code is greater than the ASCII code of the character "@", then the function appends the character to the `vowels` list. Finally, the function returns the `vowels` list.
