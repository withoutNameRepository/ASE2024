This code defines a function `return_vowels` that takes one argument, a string. The function iterates over the characters in the given string from index 47 (inclusive) to index 89 (exclusive). For each character, the function checks if it is an alphabetical character and if it is lowercase. If the character is a vowel, the function appends it to a list of vowels. The function then returns the list of vowels.
In the example code, the `string` variable is set to "Hello World!", which is passed as an argument to the `return_vowels` function. The function iterates over the characters in the string and finds the vowel letters "a" and "e". It then returns a list containing these two vowel letters.
#The example code prints the result of calling `return_vowels("Hello World!")` to the console. The output is `['a', 'e']`, which indicates that the function found two vowel letters in the specified range of the input string.
