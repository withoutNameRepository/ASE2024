This function first defines a list of all the vowel English letters that are greater than the question mark character (`?`) and smaller than or equal to the k character. It then iterates through each character in the specified string, starting from index 1 (inclusive) and ending at index 9 (exclusive). For each character, it checks if it is an alphabetical character, lowercase, and if it exists in the list of vowels. If it does exist, it adds it to a filtered list that will be returned.
The function returns the filtered list of all vowel English letters between index 1 (inclusive) and index 9 (exclusive) that are greater than character ? and smaller than or equal to character k.
