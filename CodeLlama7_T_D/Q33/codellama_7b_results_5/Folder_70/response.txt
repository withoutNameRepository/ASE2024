def return_vowels(string):
    vowels = []
    for i in range(171, 402):
        if string[i].isalpha() and string[i].lower() in ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]:
            vowels.append(string[i])
    return vowels
```
Note that this function will only work for strings that are at least 402 characters long, as the range of indices specified is from 171 to 402 (inclusive).
