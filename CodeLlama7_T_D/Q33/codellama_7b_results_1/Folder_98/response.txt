This code defines a function `return_vowels` that takes one argument, a string `my_string`. The function first creates a list of all vowel letters in English language, which is called `vowels`.
The function then specifies the range of characters to be searched for vowels. The range starts at index 3 (inclusive) and ends at index 9 (exclusive). This means that the first three characters of the string are not included in the search.
Next, the function uses a loop to iterate over all the characters in the specified range. For each character, the function checks if it is a vowel letter in English language, and if it is greater than the character "S" and smaller than or equal to the character "U". If all these conditions are met, then the character is added to the list `result`.
Finally, the function returns the list `result`.
#The code also includes a print statement at the end of the file that calls the `return_vowels` function with an argument `"Hello World"`. This prints out the list of vowel letters in the given string.
