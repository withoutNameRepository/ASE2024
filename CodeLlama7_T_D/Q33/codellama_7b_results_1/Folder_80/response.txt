def return_vowels(my_string):
    vowels = []
    for i in range(85, 99):
        if my_string[i] in "aeiou" and my_string[i] > "/" and my_string[i] <= "n":

This code defines a function called `return_vowels` that takes one argument, a string. The function first initializes an empty list called `vowels`. It then iterates through the characters in the specified range of the input string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if the character is a vowel (i.e., it is either "a", "e", "i", "o", or "u"), and if the character is greater than "/" and smaller than or equal to "n". If both conditions are true, the function appends the current character to the `vowels` list. Finally, the function returns the `vowels` list.
