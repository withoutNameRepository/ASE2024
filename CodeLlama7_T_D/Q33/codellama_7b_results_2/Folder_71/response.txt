def return_vowels(string):
    vowels = []
    for i in range(36, 57):

```
This code defines a function called `return_vowels` that takes a single argument, a string. The function then uses a for loop to iterate over the indices of the string from 36 to 57 (inclusive). For each index, the code checks if the character at that index is a vowel and if it is greater than the plus sign (+) and smaller than or equal to the forward slash (/). If these conditions are met, the function appends the character at that index to the list of vowels. Finally, the function returns the list of vowels.
