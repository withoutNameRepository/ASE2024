 ```
def insert_before_character(string, character):
    return string.replace(character, f"{character}")
```
Explanation:

The `insert_before_character` function takes two arguments: `string`, which is the input string that may contain the specified character; and `character`, which is the specific character that we want to insert before in the input string.
Inside the function, we use the `replace()` method of the input string to replace all occurrences of the specified character with itself followed by the specified character. For example, if the input string is "Hello World" and the specified character is "A", then the output string will be "HellAo WrA".
Note that we use the `f` string prefix to indicate that the subsequent string is a formatted string, which allows us to include variables in the string. In this case, we use the variable `character` to specify the character that we want to insert before.
