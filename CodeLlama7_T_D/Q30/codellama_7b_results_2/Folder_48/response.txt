def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("S", "U")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original string except that the character 'U' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'S'.
The function uses the `replace()` method of strings to perform the replacement. The first argument to `replace()` is the substring to be replaced (in this case, "S"), and the second argument is the substring to be inserted (in this case, "U"). The method returns a new string with the specified replacements made.
