 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
return string.replace("F", "uF")
```
This function takes a single argument, `string`, which is the input string that may or may not contain the character 'F'.
The function then uses the `replace()` method to search for occurrences of the character 'F' in the input string and replaces them with the new string "uF". The "u" stands for "underscore", which we will use as a placeholder for the inserted character.
Finally, the modified input string is returned by the function.
