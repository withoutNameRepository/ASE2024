def insert_before_character(string, character):
    return string.replace(character, f"M{character}")
```
This function takes two arguments: `string` and `character`. It returns a new string that is identical to the original except for the fact that the character `'M'` has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the given `character` in the input `string`.
