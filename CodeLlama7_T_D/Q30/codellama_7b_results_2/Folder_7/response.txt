 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace(" ", "H ")
```
This function takes a single argument `string`, which is the input string that needs to be processed. The function then uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character `' '` (a space) in the input string with character `'H'` followed by a space. This will effectively insert the character `'H'` before each occurrence of the space character in the input string.
For example, if we call the function with the input string `"Hello World"`, it will return the output string `"HHello World"`.
