 ```
def insert_before_character(string, character):
    return string.replace(character, f'{character} ')

string = "Hello World!"
#print(insert_before_character(string, 'T'))
```
This code defines a function called `insert_before_character` that takes two arguments: a string and a character. The function returns a new string that is identical to the original except that the specified character has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character in the original string.
The code then demonstrates how to use this function by calling it with a sample string and inserting the character 'T' before all occurrences of the character. The output should be the original string with the inserted character.
