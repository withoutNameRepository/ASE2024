 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("E", "T" + "E")
```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument `string` which is a string. The function returns a new string that is identical to the original string except for the insertion of character 'T' immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'E'.
This is done using the `replace()` method, which replaces all occurrences of a given substring with a new substring. In this case, the substring to be replaced is "E", and the new substring is "T" + "E". This will insert the character 'T' immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'E'.
