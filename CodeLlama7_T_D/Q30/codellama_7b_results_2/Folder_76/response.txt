 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("F", "mF")
```
Explanation:

The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character 'm' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'F'. The function achieves this by using the `.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'F' in the input string with the string "mF". This has the effect of inserting the character 'm' immediately before each occurrence of character 'F' in the input string.
