 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("o", "O")
```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string. The function then uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the character 'o' with the character 'O'. The resulting string is then returned by the function.
