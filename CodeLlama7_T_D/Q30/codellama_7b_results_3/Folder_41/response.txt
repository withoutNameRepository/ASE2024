 Here is a Python function that meets the specified requirements:
```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("O", "oO")
```
This function takes a single argument, `string`, which should be a string. The function then replaces all occurrences of the character 'O' in the input string with the string "oO". This will result in an output string that is identical to the input string except that the character 'O' has been replaced by the string "oO".
