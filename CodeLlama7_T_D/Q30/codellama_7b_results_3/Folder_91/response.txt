 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("a", "0a")
```
This code uses the `replace()` method of the `str` class to replace all occurrences of the character `'a'` with the character `'0a'`. This effectively inserts the character `'0'` immediately before any occurrence of the character `'a'`.
