def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("F", "uF")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, `string`, which is assumed to be a non-empty string. The function returns a new string that is identical to the original except that every occurrence of the character 'F' has been replaced by the string "uF". The resulting string will contain the inserted character 'u' immediately preceding any occurrences of the character 'F'.
