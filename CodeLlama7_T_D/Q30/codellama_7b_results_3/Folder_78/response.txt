 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("H", "sH")
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical except that the character 's' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'H'.
For example, if we call the function with the argument `"Hello World"`, it will return the string `"elsHelo World"`.
