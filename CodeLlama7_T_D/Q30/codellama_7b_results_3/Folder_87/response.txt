 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("m", "Nm")
```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument `string`, which is the input string that may or may not contain the character 'm'. The function then uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of 'm' in the input string with 'Nm', inserting the character 'N' immediately preceding each occurrence. Finally, the function returns the modified input string.
