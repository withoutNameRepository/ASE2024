 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("r", "1r")
```
Explanation:

The function takes a string argument and returns a new string that is identical except for the addition of character '1' immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'r'.
This is achieved by using the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'r' with "1r", while preserving the original string.
