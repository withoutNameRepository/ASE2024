 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("t", "u")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string of characters. The function then uses the `replace()` method to replace any occurrences of the character `'t'` with the string `"u"`. This results in a new string that is identical to the original string except for the insertion of the character `'u'` immediately preceding any occurrences of the character `'t'`.
