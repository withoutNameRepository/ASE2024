 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace('I', 'i') + 'i'
```
This function takes a string as its argument and returns a new string that is identical to the original except that the character 'i' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'I'. The function uses the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of 'I' with 'i', and then adds the character 'i' at the end of the returned string.
