 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace('i', 'I')

```
Explanation:

The `insert_before_character` function takes a single argument, which is the input string. The function then uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of the character `'i'` with the character `'I'`. The resulting string is returned by the function.
For example, if we call the `insert_before_character` function with the input string `"hello world"`), it will return the string `"HeLlO WoRlD"`, because all occurrences of the character `'i'` have been replaced with the character `'I'`.
