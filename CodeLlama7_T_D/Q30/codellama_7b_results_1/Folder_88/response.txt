 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("a", "t\na")
```
This function takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string. It then uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the character 'a' in the input string with the character 't' followed by the character 'a'. The resulting output string will contain the character 't' inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'a' in the input string.
