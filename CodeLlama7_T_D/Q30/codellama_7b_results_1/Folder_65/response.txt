 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("6", "96")
```
Explanation:

The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character '9' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character '6'.
To accomplish this, the function uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character '6' with the string "96". This effectively inserts the character '9' before each occurrence of character '6'.
