 Here's the code for the function `insert_before_character`:
```python
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("o", "a" + "o")
```
This code replaces all occurrences of the character 'o' in the input string with the string 'a' followed by 'o'. This is done using the `str.replace()` method, which replaces all occurrences of a specified substring in a given string. In this case, we are replacing all occurrences of 'o' with 'a' + 'o'.
