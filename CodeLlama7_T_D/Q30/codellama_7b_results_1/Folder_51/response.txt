 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
return string.replace("o", "O").replace("o", "O")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument, `string`, which is the input string to be modified.
The function first replaces all occurrences of character 'o' with character 'O' using the `replace()` method. This ensures that any existing instances of character 'O' are replaced before inserting new ones.
The function then replaces any remaining occurrences of character 'o' with character 'O' using the same `replace()` method. This ensures that all instances of character 'o' in the input string are replaced with character 'O'.
Finally, the modified input string is returned by the function.
