 Here is a possible implementation of the `insert_before_character` function in Python:
```
def insert_before_character(string, character):
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == character:
            new_string += "U" + string[i]
        else:
            new_string += string[i]
    return new_string
```
This function takes two arguments: `string`, which is the input string, and `character`, which is the character to insert before. The function returns a new string that is identical to the input string except that the specified character has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of that character.
