 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("F", "oF")
```
Explanation:

The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character `'o'` has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character `'F'`.
This is done using the `replace()` method of the string object. In this case, we replace all occurrences of the substring `"F"` with the substring `"oF"`, which inserts the character `'o'` immediately before each occurrence of the letter `'F'`.
