def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace('a', '0a')
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string. The function returns a modified version of the input string, where any occurrence of character 'a' has been replaced with the string "0a". This ensures that the output string will have the same length as the original input string, and will contain all of the same characters except for any occurrences of character 'a'.
