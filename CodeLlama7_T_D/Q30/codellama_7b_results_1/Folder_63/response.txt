 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("5", "R5")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument `string`, which is a string that may or may not contain the character '5'.
The function uses the `replace()` method to replace any occurrence of '5' in the original string with 'R5', where 'R' stands for "before". The resulting string will have all occurrences of '5' preceded by the character 'R'.
For example, if the input string is "Hello 5 world", then the output string will be "Hello R5 world".
