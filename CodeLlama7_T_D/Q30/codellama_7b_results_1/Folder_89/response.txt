 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace(" ", "W")
```
Explanation:

The `insert_before_character` function takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string. The function returns a new string that is identical to the original except that every occurrence of the space character (`" "`) has been replaced with the string `"W"` immediately preceding it.
For example, if we call the function with the argument `string = "Hello World!"`, the function will return the string `"HWello WWorld!"`.
