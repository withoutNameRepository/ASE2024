 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("o", "h" + "o")
```
This function takes a single argument `string`, which is the input string that may or may not contain the character 'h'. The function then uses the `replace()` method to search for all occurrences of the character 'o' in the input string and replace them with the desired output of inserting the character 'h' before each occurrence of the character 'o'.
For example, if we call the function with the input string `"hello"`, it will return the output string `"hhello"`, because it has inserted the character 'h' before each occurrence of the character 'o'.
