def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("B", "N") + "B"
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original string except that any occurrence of the character 'B' has been replaced with the character 'N' immediately preceding it. The function then adds the character 'B' back to the end of the string, so that the resulting string still contains the same characters as the original string, just in a different order.
