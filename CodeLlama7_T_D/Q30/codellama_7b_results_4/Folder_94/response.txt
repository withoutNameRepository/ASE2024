 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace(" ", "5 ")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical except that the character `'5'` has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character `' '` in the original string.
To achieve this, we use the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the space character with the modified character sequence `"5 "`. This will ensure that the new character sequence is correctly inserted before each occurrence of the space character.
