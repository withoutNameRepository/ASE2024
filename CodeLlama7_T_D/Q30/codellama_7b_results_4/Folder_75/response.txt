 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("U", "qU")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character 'q' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'U'.
The implementation uses the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'U' in the input string with the substring "qU". This ensures that the output string contains character 'q' immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'U'.
