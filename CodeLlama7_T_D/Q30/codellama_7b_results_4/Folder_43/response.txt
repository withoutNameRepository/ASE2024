 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace('t', 'Gt')
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument `string`, which is a string object in Python. It then uses the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the character 't' in the string with 'Gt'. The resulting string will be identical except for any occurrences of the character 't', which have been replaced with 'Gt'.
