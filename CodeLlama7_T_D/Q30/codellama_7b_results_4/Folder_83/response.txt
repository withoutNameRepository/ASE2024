 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
return string.replace("E", "e") + "e"
```
This code uses the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the character 'E' with the character 'e'. It then appends the character 'e' to the end of the resulting string, which inserts it immediately preceding any remaining occurrences of the character 'E'.
