 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("g", "tg")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument, `string`, which is the input string that may or may not contain the character 'g'. The function then uses the `str.replace()` method to replace any occurrence of the character 'g' with the string "tg". This has the effect of inserting the character 't' immediately preceding any occurrences of the character 'g'.
For example, if the input string is "hello", then the output string would be "hellotg". If the input string is "hello world", then the output string would be "hello tgworld".
Note that this solution assumes that the character 't' should only be inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character 'g'. If other characters should also be inserted before the 'g', then additional logic would need to be added to the function.
