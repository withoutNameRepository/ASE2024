 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("N", "jN")
```
Explanation:

The `insert_before_character` function takes a string as its argument and returns a new string with the character 'j' inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'N'.
The function uses the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'N' in the input string with character 'jN', effectively inserting the character 'j' before each occurrence of character 'N'. The returned string is then returned by the function.
