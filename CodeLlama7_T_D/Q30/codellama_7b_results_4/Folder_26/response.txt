 Here is the Python code for the given text specification:
```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("r", "wr")
```
This function takes a single argument `string`, which is a string that may or may not contain the character 'r'. The function then replaces any occurrences of 'r' in the original string with 'wr', resulting in a new string that is identical except for the insertion of the character 'w' before any occurrences of 'r'.
