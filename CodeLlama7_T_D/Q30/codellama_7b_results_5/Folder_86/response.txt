def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("O", "QO")
```

The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string. It uses the `replace()` method to replace any occurrences of character 'O' in the input string with character 'Q' followed by the original character 'O'. The resulting string is then returned.
