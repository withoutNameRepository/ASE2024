 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("6", "96")
```
This function takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string that may or may not contain the character "6". The function returns a new string that is identical to the original string except that any occurrence of the character "6" has been replaced with the character "9" followed by the character "6". For example, if the input string is "abc6def", then the output string would be "abc96def".
