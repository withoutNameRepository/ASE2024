 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("2", "S2")
```
Explanation:

The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the input string except that the character 'S' has been inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character '2'.
This can be done using the `replace()` method of the string. The `replace()` method takes two arguments: the first is the substring to replace, and the second is the replacement substring. In this case, we want to replace all occurrences of the character '2' with the substring 'S2', so we pass '2' as the first argument and 'S2' as the second argument.
The resulting string will have the character 'S' inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character '2'.
