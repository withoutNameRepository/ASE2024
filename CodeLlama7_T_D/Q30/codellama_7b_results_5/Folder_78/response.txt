 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("s", "").replace("H", "sH")
```
Explanation:

The `insert_before_character` function takes a single argument, a string. The function first replaces all occurrences of the character 's' in the input string with an empty string using the `string.replace()` method. This ensures that there are no existing 's' characters in the input string.
Next, the function replaces all occurrences of the character 'H' in the input string with the string "sH" using the `string.replace()` method again. This inserts the character 's' immediately preceding any occurrences of the character 'H'.
Finally, the function returns the modified input string.
