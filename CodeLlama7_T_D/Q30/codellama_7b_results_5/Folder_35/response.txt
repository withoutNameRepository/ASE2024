def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace('9', 'M9')
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_before_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical except that the character 'M' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character '9'.
This is done using the `replace()` method of strings. The first argument to this method is the string to be replaced, in this case the character '9'. The second argument is the replacement string, in this case the character 'M' followed by the original character '9'.
The `replace()` method returns a new string that has had all occurrences of the specified string replaced with the replacement string. In this case, the new string will have had all occurrences of the character '9' replaced with the character 'M' followed by the original character '9'.
