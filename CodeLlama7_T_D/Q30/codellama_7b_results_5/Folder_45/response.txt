 ```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("O", "O")
```
This code defines a function called `insert_before_character` that takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character `'O'` has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character `'O'`. The function uses the `replace()` method to search for all occurrences of the character `'O'` in the input string, and then inserts the character `'O'` before each occurrence using the `insert()` method. The resulting modified string is returned by the function.
