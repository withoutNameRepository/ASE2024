def insert_before_character(string):
    return string.replace("Y", "4Y")

#print(insert_before_character("Hello Yellow")) # Output: Hello 4Yellow
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original except that the character '4' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of the character 'Y'. The function uses the `replace()` method to find and replace all occurrences of the character 'Y' with the character '4' followed by the character 'Y'.
