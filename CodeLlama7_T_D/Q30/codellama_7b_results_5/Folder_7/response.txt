def insert_before_character(string, character):
    return string.replace(character, f'{character}H')
```
This function takes two arguments: a string and a character. It replaces any occurrences of the specified character in the string with that character followed by the letter "H". For example, if the input string is "Hello World" and the character to insert before is " ", the output string will be "Hello WorldH H".
