```
This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the list of all integers divisible by 2 from index 20 to index 20, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
The function first initializes an empty list called `divisible_ints` to store the divisible integers. It then loops through the list of integers using a for loop and checks if each integer is divisible by 2. If the integer is divisible by 2, it adds that integer to the `divisible_ints` list.
The function returns the `divisible_ints` list at the end.
The code also includes a test case using a sample input of a list of integers from 1 to 20. The output of the test case is shown below:
```
[4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
