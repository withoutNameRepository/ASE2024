This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an input. The function returns the list of all integers divisible by 4 from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
The code first initializes an empty list called `divisible_ints` to store the divisible integers. Then it iterates through the list of integers using a for loop from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive. For each integer in the range, the code checks if it is divisible by 4 using the modulo operator (`%`). If an integer is divisible by 4, it is added to the `divisible_ints` list. Finally, the function returns the `divisible_ints` list containing all the divisible integers from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive.
In the sample input provided, there are two divisible integers (16 and 48) between index 20 and index 200, both inclusive. Therefore, the function returns the list containing these two divisible integers.
