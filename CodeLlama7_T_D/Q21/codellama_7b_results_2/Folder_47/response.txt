 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_num` function:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list, num):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []

    # Iterate through the input list and check if each element is divisible by -27
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % num == 0:
            # If the element is divisible by -27, add it to the result list
            result.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the result list
    return result
```
# (modified)

Here is an example usage of the `all_ints_div_by_num` function:
python
# Define a list of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Pass the list to the all_ints_div_by_num function and print the results
#print(all_ints_div_by_num(my_list, -27)))

This code will output the list of integers that are divisible by -27 from index 75 to index 88, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.
