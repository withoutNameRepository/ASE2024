This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a single argument, a list of integers. The function returns a list containing all integers from index 40 to index 400, both inclusive, that are divisible by 7. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
The code first initializes an empty list called `divisible_ints` to store the divisible integers. Then it iterates through the list of integers from index 40 to index 400 using a for loop. For each integer, the function checks if it is divisible by 7 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the current integer is divisible by 7, the function adds it to the `divisible_ints` list.
Finally, the function returns the `divisible_ints` list containing all integers from index 40 to index 400 that are divisible by 7.
The code also includes a test with a sample list of integers to demonstrate how the function works.
