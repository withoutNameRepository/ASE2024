 ```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through the list from index 60 to index 200 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(60, 201):
        # If the current element is an odd integer, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    return sum
```
The above code defines a function `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 60 to index 200, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
