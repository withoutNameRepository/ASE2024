 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list from index 22 to index 50, both inclusive
    for i in range(22, 51):
        # Check if the current element is an odd integer
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum of all odd integers from index 22 to index 50, both inclusive
    return sum
```
This implementation first initializes the `sum` variable to 0. Then, it iterates over the specified range of indices in the input list using a `for` loop. For each element in the range, the function checks if it is an odd integer by dividing it by 2 and checking if the remainder is 1. If the current element is an odd integer, the function adds it to the `sum` variable. Finally, the function returns the sum of all odd integers from index 22 to index 50, both inclusive.
