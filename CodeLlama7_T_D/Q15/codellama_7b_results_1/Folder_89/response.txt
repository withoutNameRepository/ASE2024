 Here's a solution for the given problem:
```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    sum = 0

    # Loop through the list of integers
    for i in range(56, 83):
        # Check if the current index is odd
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            # If it is odd, add it to the sum
            sum += my_list[i]

    # Return the sum of all odd integers from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive
    return sum
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
