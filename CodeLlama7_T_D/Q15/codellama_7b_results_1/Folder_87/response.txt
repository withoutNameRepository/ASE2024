 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list and sum the odd integers
    for i in range(36, 47):
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    return sum
```
The function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is assumed to be a list of integers. The function then loops through the indices from 36 to 47 in the input list, and for each index that contains an odd integer, adds that integer to the running total `sum`. If no odd integers exist within the specified range, the function returns 0.
