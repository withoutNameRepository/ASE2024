 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Iterate over the list from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive
    for i in range(246, 751):
        # Check if the current element is an odd integer
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            total += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum
    return total
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.
