 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list from index 30 to index 200
    for i in range(30, 201):
        # If the current element is an odd integer, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This implementation first initializes the sum to 0. Then, it iterates over the list from index 30 to index 200 using a `range` object. For each element in the range, if the current element is an odd integer, it is added to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum.
