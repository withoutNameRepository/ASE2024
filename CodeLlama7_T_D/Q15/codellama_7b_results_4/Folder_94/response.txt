 ```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0

    # Loop through the list from index 28 to 40 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(28, 41):
        # If the current element is an odd integer, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            total += my_list[i]

    # Return the sum of all odd integers from index 28 to index 40 (both inclusive), or 0 if no such integers exist.
    return total

```
The text specification is: Write a function called 'sum_odd_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 28 to index 40, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
This Python code has been delimited only by triple backticks. It contains one solution that fulfills the text specification.
