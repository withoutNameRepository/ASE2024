 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    sum = 0

    # Loop through the list from index 50 to index 200, both inclusive
    for i in range(50, 201):
        # Check if the current element is an odd integer
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += my_list[i]

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list`, which should be a list of integers. The function then loops through the elements of `my_list` from index 50 to index 200, both inclusive, and checks if each element is an odd integer. If it is, the function adds that element to the running sum. Finally, the function returns the sum of all odd integers in the specified range, or 0 if no such integers exist.
