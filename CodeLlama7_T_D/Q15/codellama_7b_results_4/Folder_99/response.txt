    return total

# Test the function with a sample list

This code defines a function called `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 310 to index 370, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
The function first initializes a variable `total` to store the sum. Then it iterates through the list and adds up the odd integers in the specified range. The loop starts at index 310 and ends at index 370 + 1 (inclusive). If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
The code also includes a test case with a sample list to demonstrate how the function works.
