Explanation:

* The function takes one argument `my_list`, which is a list of strings.
* We first check if there are at least 4 pairs of anagrams in the list by initializing a counter variable `num_pairs` and setting it to 0.
* We then iterate over each pair of adjacent strings in the list using two nested for loops.
* Inside each iteration, we use the `is_anagram()` function to check if the two strings are anagrams of each other. If they are, we increment the `num_pairs` counter by 1.
* Finally, we return the value of `num_pairs` as our final output. If it is greater than or equal to 4, then there are at least 4 pairs of anagrams in the list, and we return True. Otherwise, if `num_pairs` is less than 4, then there are not enough pairs of anagrams in the list, and we return False.
