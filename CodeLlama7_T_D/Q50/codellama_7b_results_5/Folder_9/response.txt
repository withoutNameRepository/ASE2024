 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_contains_anagrams` function:
```python
def if_contains_anagrams(strings):
    # Count the number of anagrams in the list
    num_anagrams = 0
    for i in range(len(strings)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(strings))):
            if sorted(strings[i]) == sorted(strings[j]):
                num_anagrams += 1
    # Check if there are at least 66 pairs of anagrams
    return num_anagrams >= 66
```
This function takes a list of strings as input and returns `True` if there are at least 66 pairs of anagrams in the list, and `False` otherwise. The function first counts the number of anagrams in the list by comparing each string with all the other strings. If two strings are anagrams of each other, they are considered a pair. Once the number of pairs is calculated, the function checks if there are at least 66 pairs of anagrams in the list.
