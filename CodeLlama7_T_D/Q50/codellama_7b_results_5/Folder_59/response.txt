 Here is a Python implementation of the specified function:
```
def if_contains_anagrams(words):
    # Count the number of pairs of anagrams in the list
    num_pairs = 0
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        word1 = words[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
            word2 = words[j]
            # Check if word1 and word2 are anagrams
            if sorted(word1.lower()) == sorted(word2.lower()):
                num_pairs += 1
    return num_pairs >= 10
```
This code defines a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a single argument, a list of strings. The function first counts the number of pairs of anagrams in the given list. It then returns `True` if there are at least 10 pairs of anagrams in the list, and `False` otherwise.
Note that this code assumes that the input list contains only strings. If the list may contain other types of objects, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
