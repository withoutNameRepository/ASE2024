 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_contains_anagrams` function:
```python
def if_contains_anagrams(words):
    # Create a set to store all anagram pairs
    anagram_pairs = set()
    # Loop through each word in the list
    for word in words:
        # Get the length of the word
        word_length = len(word)
        # If the word is at least three characters long, continue
        if word_length >= 3:
            # Create a list to store all anagrams of the word
            anagrams = []
            # Loop through each letter in the word
            for letter in word:
                # Get the index of the letter in the word
                index = word.index(letter)
                # If the letter is not the first letter, add it to the list of anagrams
                if index != 0:
                    anagrams.append(letter)
            # If there are at least seven pairs of anagrams in the list, return True
            if len(anagram_pairs) >= 7:
                return True

    # If there are no anagram pairs in the list, return False
    return False
```
