```
This code uses a nested for loop to iterate over the list of strings and compare each string with all other strings. The `sorted` function is used to sort the characters in each string, so that we can easily check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
The function returns `True` if there are at least 106 pairs of anagrams in the given list, and `False` otherwise.
