Explanation:

The function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings as input. It then iterates over each pair of strings in the list, and checks if they are anagrams of each other. If they are, the function increments a counter variable called `anagram_count`.
Once the iteration is complete, the function checks if the value of `anagram_count` is greater than or equal to 314. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that there are at least 314 pairs of anagrams in the given list. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
The function also takes into account the length of the strings being compared. It only considers strings that are at least three characters long to be considered for comparison as anagrams. This is done by checking if the length of each string is greater than or equal to 3 before comparing them.
