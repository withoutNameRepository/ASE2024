This code defines two functions: `if_contains_anagrams` and `is_anagram`. The `if_contains_anagrams` function takes a list of strings as its argument, and returns `True` if there are at least 188 pairs of anagrams in the list. The function uses the `is_anagram` function to check whether two words are anagrams of each other.
The `is_anagram` function takes two strings as its arguments, and returns `True` if they are anagrams of each other. The function first converts both strings to lowercase using the `.lower()` method. It then sorts the characters in each string using the `sorted()` function. Finally, it checks whether the sorted characters in the two strings are the same, by comparing them using the `==` operator.
In the code example at the end of this response, we test the `if_contains_anagrams` function with a list of words that contain anagrams. The list includes the words "listen", "silent", "enamel", and "animal". When we call the `if_contains_anagrams` function on this list, it returns `True`, indicating that there are at least 188 pairs of anagrams in the list.
