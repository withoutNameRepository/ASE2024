 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_contains_anagrams` function:
```python
def if_contains_anagrams(words):
    # Check if there are at least 70 pairs of anagrams in the list
    num_anagrams = 0
    for i in range(len(words)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(words)):
            if sorted(words[i]) == sorted(words[j]):
                num_anagrams += 1
    return num_anagrams >= 70
```
This function takes a list of strings as input and returns `True` if there are at least 70 pairs of anagrams in the list, or `False` otherwise. It uses a nested loop to iterate over the list of strings and compare each string to every other string in the list. If two strings are anagrams of each other, the function increments a counter that keeps track of the number of anagrams it has found. Once it has iterated through the entire list, the function checks if the number of anagrams it has found is greater than or equal to 70, and returns `True` if it is, or `False` otherwise.
