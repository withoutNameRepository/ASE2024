Explanation:

The function `if_contains_anagrams` takes a list of strings as its argument. The function first checks if there are at least 35 pairs of anagrams in the given list. If there are, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
To find anagrams, the function uses the `sorted` function to sort the letters of each string in alphabetical order. If the sorted letters of two strings are the same, then they are anagrams. The function counts the number of pairs of anagrams and compares it with 35.
The function also takes care to only consider anagrams of length at least three. This is done by checking that the lengths of the two strings being compared are at least three.
