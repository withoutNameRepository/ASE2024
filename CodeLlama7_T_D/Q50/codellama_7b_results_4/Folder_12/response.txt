                # Check if there are at least 69 pairs of anagrams in the list

This code uses a nested loop to compare each string with every other string in the list. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the strings before comparing them, so that anagrams are detected regardless of the order of the letters. The `continue` keyword is used to skip to the next iteration of the loop if there is no match between two strings.
The `if_contains_anagrams()` function takes a single argument, which is a list of strings. It first counts the number of pairs of anagrams in the list by using nested loops. If there are at least 69 pairs of anagrams in the list, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
Note that this code only considers anagrams of length at least three. This is because anagrams with fewer than three letters can be easily checked by simply comparing the strings directly, and there is no need to sort them first.
