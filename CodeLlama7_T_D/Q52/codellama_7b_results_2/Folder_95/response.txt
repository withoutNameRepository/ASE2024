 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_n` function:
```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Check if the current character is a palindrome of length n
        if string[i:i+n] == string[i:i+n][::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(string[i:i+n])
    return palindromes
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a set of all palindromes of length equal to 87, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
