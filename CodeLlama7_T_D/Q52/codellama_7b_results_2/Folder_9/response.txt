 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_n` function:
```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over the characters in the string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Get the character at position i
        char = string[i]
        # Check if the character is a letter (a-zA-Z)
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z' or 'A' <= char <= 'Z':
            # If it is, check if there are any palindromes of length n starting with this character
            for j in range(i, i + n):
                # Get the substring starting at position j and ending at position i + n - 1 (inclusive)
                substr = string[j:i + n]
                # Check if the substring is a palindrome
                if substr == substr[::-1]:
                    # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
                    palindromes.add(substr)
    # Return the set of palindromes found in the string
    return palindromes
```
