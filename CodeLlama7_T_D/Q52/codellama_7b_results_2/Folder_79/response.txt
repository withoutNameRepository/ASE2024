 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_n` function:
```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Convert the input string to lowercase
    string = string.lower()
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Check if the current character is a letter (not a space or punctuation)
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Initialize an empty string to store the palindrome
            palindrome = ""
            # Loop through each character in the input string starting from the current character and moving backwards
            for j in range(i, -1, -1):
                # Check if the current character is a letter (not a space or punctuation)
                if string[j].isalpha():
                    # Add the current character to the palindrome string
                    palindrome += string[j]
            # Check if the palindrome has the desired length (64 in this case) and if it consists only of English letters
            if len(palindrome) == 64 and all(c.isalpha() for c in palindrome)):
                # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
                palindromes.add(palindrome)
    # Return the set of palindromes found in the input string
    return palindromes
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate through each character in the input string and then iterates backwards from the current character to check if the substring starting at the current character is a palindrome. The `isalpha()` method is used to check if each character is an English letter (not a space or punctuation). If a palindrome with the desired length is found, it is added to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes found in the input string.
