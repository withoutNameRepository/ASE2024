This code defines a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a single string argument and returns a set of all palindromes of the length equal to 76, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. The function uses a nested for loop to iterate through each substring of length n in the given string, and then checks if each substring is a palindrome using the `==` operator with a reversed version of the same substring. If the substring is a palindrome, it is added to the set of palindromes, which is returned at the end of the function.
