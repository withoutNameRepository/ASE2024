This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a string as input and returns the set of all palindromes of length 45, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. The function first initializes an empty set to store the palindromes and then loops through each character in the input string. For each character, the function gets the substring starting from the current character and ending at a length of 45 and checks if it is a palindrome. If it is, the function adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes found in the input string.
