```
This code uses a for loop to iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, it checks if it is a letter using the `isalpha()` method. If it is a letter, it creates a substring of length 64 starting from that character using slicing. It then checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its own reversed version using slicing again. If the substring is a palindrome, it adds it to a set of palindromes and returns the set at the end.
