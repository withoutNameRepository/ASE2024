This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a single argument, a string, and returns a set of all palindromes of length n that are substrings of the given string. The function uses the `isalpha()` method to check if each character in the string is a letter, and the `[:]` notation to extract substrings. The function also uses the `set()` type to store the palindromes in a set for efficient membership testing.
