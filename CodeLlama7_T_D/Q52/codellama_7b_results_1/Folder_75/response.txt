This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns the set of all palindromes of length 80, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. The function finds the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner by comparing the original substring with its reverse. If there are no palindromes of length 80 as substrings of the given string, the function returns an empty set.
