def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Create a list of all substrings of length n in the string
    substrings = [string[i:i+n] for i in range(len(string)-n+1)]

This code defines a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a string as an argument and returns the set of all palindromes of length n that are substrings of the given string. The function first creates a list of all substrings of length n in the string using list comprehension. It then filters out substrings that are not palindromes by checking if they are equal to their reverse. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.
Note that this code assumes that the input string is a valid Python string and does not contain any special characters. If the input string contains special characters, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
