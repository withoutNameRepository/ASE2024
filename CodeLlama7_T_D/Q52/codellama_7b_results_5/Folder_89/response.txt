def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Find all substrings of length n in the given string
    substrings = [string[i:i+n] for i in range(len(string)-n+1)]

```
This code defines a function called `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a single argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 37, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
