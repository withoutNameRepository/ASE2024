This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a single string argument and returns a set containing all palindromes of length equal to 69, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. The function first initializes an empty set to store the palindromes. Then, it loops through each character in the string using a for loop. For each character, the function gets the corresponding substring starting from that character and ending at the end of the string. Then, it checks if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If it is a palindrome, the function adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
