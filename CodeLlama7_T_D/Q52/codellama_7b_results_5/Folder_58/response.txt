This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a single argument, which is a string. The function returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 223, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string.
The function first creates a list of all substrings of length n in the given string using a list comprehension. It then filters out substrings that are not palindromes by checking if they are equal to their reverse. The resulting list of palindromes is returned as a set.
