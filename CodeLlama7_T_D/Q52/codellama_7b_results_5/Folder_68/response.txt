This function takes a single argument, `string`, which is the input string that contains the substrings to be searched for palindromes. It returns a set of all palindromes of length 76, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. The function finds the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner by comparing the original substring with its reverse. If two substrings are equal when compared in this way, they are considered to be palindromes.
