 ```
def palindrome_of_length_n(string, n):
    # Find all substrings of length n in the string
    substrings = [string[i:i+n] for i in range(len(string)-n+1)]
    # Filter out substrings that are not palindromes
    palindromes = [s for s in substrings if s == s[::-1]]
    return set(palindromes)
```
This function takes two arguments: a string and an integer `n`. It finds all substrings of length `n` in the given string, and filters out those that are not palindromes. The filtered palindromes are then returned as a set.
Note that this function is case-insensitive, so it does not matter whether the input string is uppercase or lowercase.
