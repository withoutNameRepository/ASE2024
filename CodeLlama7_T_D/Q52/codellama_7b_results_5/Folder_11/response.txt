def palindrome_of_length_n(string, n):
    # Create a list of all substrings of length n in the given string
    substrings = [string[i:i+n] for i in range(len(string)-n+1)]
    # Filter out non-palindromes and return the set of palindromes
    return {s for s in substrings if s == s[::-1]}
```
This function takes two arguments: `string`, a string, and `n`, an integer representing the length of the palindromes to be searched. It returns a set of all palindromes of the specified length that are substrings of the given string. The search is performed in a case-insensitive manner, meaning that both uppercase and lowercase letters are considered equivalent when searching for palindromes.
