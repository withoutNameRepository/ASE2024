This function takes a string as input, and returns the set of all palindromes of length n that are substrings of the given string. The function first removes all non-alphabetical characters from the string, then creates a list of all substrings of length n using slicing. Finally, the function filters the substrings to only include those that are palindromes by comparing them to their reversed form.
