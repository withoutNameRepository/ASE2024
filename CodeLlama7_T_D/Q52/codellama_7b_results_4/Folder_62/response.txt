def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Case-insensitive search for palindromes of length n in the given string
    palindromes = set()
    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):
        substring = string[i:i+n]

```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes of the length equal to 188, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
The function first creates an empty set to store the palindromes. Then it iterates through each substring of the given string with a length equal to 188 using a nested for loop. For each substring, the function checks if it is a palindrome by comparing its original and reversed version. If they match, the function adds the palindrome to the set of palindromes.
After iterating through all substrings, the function returns the set of palindromes found in the given string.
