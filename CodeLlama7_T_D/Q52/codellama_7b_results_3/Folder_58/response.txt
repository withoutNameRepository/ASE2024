 ```
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()

    # Loop through each substring of length n in the given string
    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome in a case-insensitive manner
        if string[i:i+n].lower() == string[i:i+n].lower()[::-1]:
            # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(string[i:i+n])

    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This code uses a similar approach as before, but with a few additional features to make it more efficient and flexible.
First, we define a function called `palindrome_of_length_n`, which takes one argument: a string. This function returns the set of all palindromes of length equal to 223, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters.
Inside this function, we first initialize an empty set called `palindromes` to store the palindromes. We then loop through each substring of length n in the given string using a for loop. Inside the loop, we check if the current substring is a palindrome in a case-insensitive manner by comparing its lowercase and uppercase versions. If it is, we add it to the set `palindromes`.
Finally, we return the set of palindromes found in the given string.
