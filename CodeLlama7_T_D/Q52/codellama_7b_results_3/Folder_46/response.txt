 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_n` function:
```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each substring of the input string
    for i in range(len(string) - 463):
        # Check if the current substring is a palindrome
        if string[i:i+464] == string[i:i+464][::-1]:
            # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(string[i:i+464])
    return palindromes
```
This code uses a loop to iterate through each substring of the input string that is 463 characters long (since we want the length of the palindromes to be equal to 464). For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its own reversed version. If it is a palindrome, it adds it to the set of palindromes that will be returned by the function.
