This function takes a string as input and returns a set of all palindromes of length 47 that are substrings of the given string. Each palindrome in the set should only consist of English letters. If there is no palindrome of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
