 ```
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    # Create a list of all substrings of length n in the input string
    substrings = [string[i:i+n] for i in range(len(string)-n+1)]
    # Filter the list to only include palindromes
    palindromes = [s for s in substrings if s == s[::-1]]
    return set(palindromes)
```
This code uses a list comprehension to generate all substrings of length n in the input string. It then filters this list to only include palindromes by checking that the substring is equal to its reverse. If there are no palindromes of the specified length as a substring of the given string, the function will return an empty set.
