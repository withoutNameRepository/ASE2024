This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_n` that takes a string as input and returns the set of all palindromes of length 85, where each palindrome is a substring of the given string. The function uses the `split()` method to split the input string into a list of substrings, and then checks each substring to see if it is a palindrome using the `[::-1]` indexing technique. If the substring is a palindrome, it is added to an empty set of palindromes, which is returned at the end of the function.
