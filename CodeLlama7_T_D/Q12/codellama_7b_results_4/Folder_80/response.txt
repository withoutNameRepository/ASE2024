 ```
def find_smallest_num(my_list):
return min(my_list[13:68+1])
```
Explanation:

The `find_smallest_num` function takes a list of numbers as its argument and returns the smallest element from index 13 to index 68, both inclusive.
To achieve this, the function uses the built-in `min` function with a slice of the input list. The slice includes elements from index 13 to index 68 (both inclusive), as specified in the problem statement.
