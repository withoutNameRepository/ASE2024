 Here is the function `find_smallest_num` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest element from index 74 to index 95, both inclusive:
```
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    smallest = None

    for i in range(74, 96):
        if smallest is None or numbers[i] < smallest:
            smallest = numbers[i]

    return smallest
```
