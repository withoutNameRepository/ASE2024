 ```
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
return min(numbers[0:4])
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest element from index 0 to index 3, both inclusive. The code uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest element in the specified range.
