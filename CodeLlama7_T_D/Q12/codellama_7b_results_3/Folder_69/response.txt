 ```
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
return min(numbers[28:32+1])
```
Explanation:

The `find_smallest_num` function takes a single argument, which is a list of numbers. The function returns the smallest element from index 28 to index 32, both inclusive.
To implement this functionality, we use the built-in `min` function in Python. We pass it a slice object containing the elements from index 28 to index 32. The `+1` at the end of the slice is necessary because slices are not inclusive on the right side by default.
By using the `min` function, we ensure that the smallest element in the given list is returned as output.
