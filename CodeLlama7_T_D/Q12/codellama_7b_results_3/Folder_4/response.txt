def find_smallest_num(my_list):
    smallest = None
    for i in range(42, 68 + 1):

```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument. It then iterates over the indices from 42 to 68, both inclusive. For each index, it checks if the current element is smaller than the previously found smallest element (or if this is the first iteration and there is no such element). If the current element is smaller, it updates the reference to the smallest element. Finally, it returns the smallest element found during the iterations.
