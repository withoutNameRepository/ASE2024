 ```
def find_smallest_num(my_list):
    return min(my_list[4:9])

```
This function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of numbers. It then uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest element from index 4 to index 8, both inclusive. The resulting smallest number is returned by the function.
