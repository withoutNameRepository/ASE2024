def find_smallest_num(numbers):
return min(numbers[17:78+1])
```
Explanation:
The function `find_smallest_num` takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the smallest element from index 17 to index 78, both inclusive.
We use the built-in `min` function to find the smallest element in the specified range. The `numbers[17:78+1]` syntax specifies that we want to select elements from index 17 to index 78 (both inclusive), and then apply the `min` function on those selected elements.
