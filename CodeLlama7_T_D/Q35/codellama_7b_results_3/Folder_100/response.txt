 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string that does not contain any repeated characters
    new_string = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for char in s:

        # Check if the current character is already in the new string
        if char not in new_string:

            # If it's not, add it to the new string
            new_string += char

    # Return the altered string
    return new_string
```
