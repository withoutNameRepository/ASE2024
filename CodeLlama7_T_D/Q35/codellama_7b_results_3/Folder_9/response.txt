def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a set of unique characters in the string
    unique_chars = set(s)
    # Initialize an empty string to store the altered string
    altered_string = ""
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is not in the set of unique characters, append it to the altered string
        if char not in unique_chars:

```
This code creates a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes one argument, a string. The function first creates a set of unique characters in the given string using the `set()` function. It then initializes an empty string to store the altered string and iterates through each character in the given string using a for loop. If a character is not in the set of unique characters, it appends that character to the altered string. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
