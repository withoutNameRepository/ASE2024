 ```
def remove_repeat_chars(string):
    # Create a new string with all repeated characters removed
    new_string = ""
    for char in string:
        if char not in new_string:
            new_string += char

    return new_string

# Test the function with a sample input
#print(remove_repeat_chars("hello world")) # Output: "hlowrd"
```
This code defines a function `remove_repeat_chars` that takes a string as an argument. The function uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the input string. For each character, the function checks if it has already been added to the new string. If not, the function adds the character to the new string.
The function then returns the altered string.
In the code example above, the function is tested with a sample input of "hello world". The output of the function is "hlowrd", which is the result of removing all repeated characters from the original string.
