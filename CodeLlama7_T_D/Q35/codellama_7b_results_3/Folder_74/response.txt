 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string that does not contain any repeated characters
    new_str = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for char in s:

        # If the current character is not already in the new string
        if char not in new_str:

            # Add the current character to the new string
            new_str += char

# Return the altered string
return new_str
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a string. It then iterates over each character in the original string and checks if it is already present in the new string. If it is not, it adds it to the new string. This process continues until all characters have been checked and added to the new string. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
