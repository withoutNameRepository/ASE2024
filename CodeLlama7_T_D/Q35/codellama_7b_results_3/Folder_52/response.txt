 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the characters in the string
    char_dict = {}
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character has already been seen before,
        if char in char_dict:
            # Remove all occurrences of the current character from the string
            s = s.replace(char, "")
        # Otherwise, add the current character to the dictionary
        else:
            char_dict[char] = True
    return s
```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. It then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop. For each character that has already been seen before, it removes all occurrences of that character from the string using the `replace` method. Finally, it returns the altered string.
For example, if we call the function with the input string "hello", it will return the output string "hell". This is because the letter "l" appears twice in the original string, but only once in the returned string.
