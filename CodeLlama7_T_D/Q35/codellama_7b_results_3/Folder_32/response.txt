 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any duplicates
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the current character is not already in the new string, add it
        if s[i] not in new_string:
            new_string += s[i]
    return new_string
```
This function takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all duplicate characters removed. It does this by iterating over the characters of the original string, and adding each character to the new string only if it is not already in the string. This ensures that no duplicates are added to the new string.
