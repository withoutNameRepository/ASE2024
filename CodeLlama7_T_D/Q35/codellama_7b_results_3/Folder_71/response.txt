 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Find all characters in the string that occur more than once between indices 20 and 35, exclusive
    duplicates = []
    for i in range(20, 35):
        if s[i] in duplicates:
            continue

        else:

            duplicates.append(s[i])

    # Remove all occurrences of each duplicate character from the string

    for c in duplicates:

        while c in s:

            s = s.replace(c, "")

    return s
```
This implementation first finds all characters in the given string that occur more than once between indices 20 and 35, exclusive (i.e., it does not count occurrences at index 20 or 35). It then removes all occurrences of each duplicate character from the string using a loop. Finally, it returns the altered string.
