 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Initialize a new string to store the altered characters
    result = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # If the current character occurs more than once between indices 10 and 28
        if s.count(c) > 1 and i >= 10 and i < 28:
            # Remove all occurrences of that character from the string
            result += c * (s.count(c) - 1)

    # Return the altered string
    return result + s[i:]
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over each character in the original string, and it uses the `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of each character. If a character occurs more than once between indices 10 and 28 (exclusive), the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string by multiplying the character by the number of occurrences minus one. The function then returns the altered string.
