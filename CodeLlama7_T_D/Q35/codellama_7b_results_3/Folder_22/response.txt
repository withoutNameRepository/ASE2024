 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function in Python:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string that will be returned at the end
    new_str = ""
    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # If the current character is not in the range of 50-200, or if it is the first occurrence of that character, add it to the new string
        if i < 50 or i > 200 or s.count(c) == 1:
            new_str += c
    # Return the altered string
    return new_str
```
This function takes a single argument, a string `s`, and it returns an altered version of that string where all characters that occur more than once between the indices 50 and 200, both exclusive, are removed from the original string while preserving the order of all characters in the original string.
