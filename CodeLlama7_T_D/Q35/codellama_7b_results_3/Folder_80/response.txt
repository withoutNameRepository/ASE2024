 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the characters of s in order
    new_string = ""
    for char in s:
        if not new_string or new_string[-1] != char:
            new_string += char

    # Remove all occurrences of each character between indices 57 and 84 (exclusive) from the string
    for i in range(57, 84):
        if s[i] in new_string:
            while s[i] in new_string:
                index = new_string.index(s[i])
                del new_string[index]

    return new_string
```
This function takes a string as input and returns the altered string with all occurrences of each character between indices 57 and 84 (exclusive) removed, while preserving the order of all characters in the string.
