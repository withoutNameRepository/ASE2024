This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns an altered string that removes any repeated characters within the given indices. The function first creates a list of characters from the input string using the `list` constructor. It then loops through each character in the list, using the `enumerate` function to get both the index and the character at that index. If the current character occurs more than once between indices 476 and 709, the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string by creating a new list without those characters using a list comprehension. Finally, the function joins the altered list of characters back into a single string using the `''.join()` method.
