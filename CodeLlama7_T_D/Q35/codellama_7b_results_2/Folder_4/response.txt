 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any duplicates
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the current character is not already in the new string
        if s[i] not in new_string:
            # Add the current character to the new string
            new_string += s[i]
    return new_string
```
