 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # create an empty list to store the characters
    chars = []

    # loop through each character in the string
    for c in s:
        # if the current character is not already in the list
        if c not in chars:
            # add the character to the list
            chars.append(c)

    # create an empty string to store the altered string
    result = ""

    # loop through each character in the list
    for c in chars:
        # check if the current character is also in the original string
        if c in s:
            # add the character to the altered string
            result += c

    return result
```
To use this function, you can pass a string as an argument and it will return the altered string. For example:
# (modified) 

s = "hello world"
# (modified) altered_string = remove_repeat_chars(s)
#print(altered_string) # Output: "hll wrld"
