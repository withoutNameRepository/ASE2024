 ```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the characters from the original string that are not repeated between indices 3 and 8
    new_str = ''
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in s[3:8]:
            new_str += s[i]
    return new_str
```
Explanation:

The `remove_repeat_chars` function takes a string as its argument. It then creates a new string called `new_str`, which is empty at first.
The function loops through each character in the original string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if that character is not present between indices 3 and 8 of the original string. If it is not present, the function adds that character to the new string `new_str`.
Finally, the function returns the altered string `new_str`.
