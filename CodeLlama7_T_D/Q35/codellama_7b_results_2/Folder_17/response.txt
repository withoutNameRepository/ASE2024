```
This code defines a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes a single argument, a string. The function iterates through each character in the given string and checks if it is already present in the new string. If it is not already present, the function adds it to the new string. The function then returns the altered string.
The sample input used for testing is "hello world". The output of the function is "helloworld", where all repeated characters have been removed while preserving the order of all characters in the string.
