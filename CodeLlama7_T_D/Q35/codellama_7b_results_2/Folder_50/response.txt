 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s
    new_s = ""
    # Iterate over the characters in s
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # If the character is not repeated between indices 13 and 76, add it to the new string
        if s.count(c) == 1 or (i >= 13 and i < 76 and s[i - 1] != c)):
            new_s += c
    # Return the altered string
    return new_s
```
This function takes a single argument, a string `s`, and removes all occurrences of characters that are repeated between indices 13 and 76, exclusive. The function creates a new string with the same characters as `s` but without any repeated characters within the specified range.
