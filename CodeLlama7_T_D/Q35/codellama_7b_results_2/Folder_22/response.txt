 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any repeated characters
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in new_string:
            new_string += s[i]
    return new_string
```
This function first creates a new string with the same characters as the input string `s`, but without any repeated characters. It then iterates over each character in the input string and adds it to the new string if it is not already present. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
