 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # create a dictionary to store the characters and their counts
    char_count = {}

    # iterate over the string and count the occurrences of each character
    for c in s:
        if c not in char_count:
            char_count[c] = 0

        char_count[c] += 1

    # iterate over the dictionary and remove all characters that occur more than once between indices 306 and 807, both exclusive
    for c in char_count.keys():
        if char_count[c] > 1:
            s = s.replace(c, "", 306, 807)

    return s
```
This function takes a string as input and returns the altered string with all characters that occur more than once between indices 306 and 807, both exclusive, removed from the string while preserving the order of all characters in the string.
