 Here's a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a set to keep track of the characters we've seen
    seen = set()

    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        if char not in seen:
            # If the character is not in the set, add it and move on
            seen.add(char)

        else:
            # If the character is already in the set, remove all occurrences of that character from the string
            new_s = s.replace(char, '')
            return new_s
```
This code creates a set to keep track of the characters we've seen so far. Then it loops through each character in the string and checks if it's already in the set. If it is, then we remove all occurrences of that character from the string by replacing it with an empty string. This effectively removes all duplicate characters from the string.
