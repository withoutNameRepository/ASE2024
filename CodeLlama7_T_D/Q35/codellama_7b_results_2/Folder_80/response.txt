 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # create a list of all characters in the string
    char_list = list(s)
    # initialize a dictionary to keep track of character frequencies
    freq = {}

    for i, c in enumerate(char_list):
        if c not in freq:
            freq[c] = 1

        else:

            freq[c] += 1


    # remove all characters that occur more than once between the indices 57 and 84, exclusive
    for i in range(57, 84):
        c = char_list[i]
        if c in freq and freq[c] > 1:
            while char_list.count(c) > 1:
                char_list.remove(c)
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, and returns the altered string with all characters that occur more than once between the indices 57 and 84, exclusive removed from it. The function first creates a list of all characters in the string using the `list()` method, then initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of character frequencies. It then iterates through each character in the string, using the `enumerate()` method to get both the index and the character at that index, and increments the frequency of each character by 1 if it is not already in the dictionary. Finally, it removes all characters from the string that occur more than once between the indices 57 and 84, exclusive, using a `while` loop to repeatedly remove the first occurrence of the character until there are no more occurrences left in the string.
