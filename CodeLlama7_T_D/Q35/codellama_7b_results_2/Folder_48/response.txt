 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # create a new string with the same characters as s
    new_str = ""
    # loop over each character in s
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # if the current character is not already in the new string
        if s[i] not in new_str:
            # add it to the end of the new string
            new_str += s[i]
    return new_str
```
This implementation uses a `for` loop to iterate over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, we check if it is already present in the new string. If not, we add it to the end of the new string. This process ensures that only unique characters are present in the output string.
Note that this implementation assumes that the indices 409 and 502 are exclusive, meaning that they do not include the character at the corresponding index.
