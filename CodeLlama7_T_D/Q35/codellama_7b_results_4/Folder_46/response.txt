 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the characters removed
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(10, 79):
        if s[i] not in new_string:
            new_string += s[i]
    return new_string
```
This function takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string. It then iterates over the characters between indices 10 and 79, exclusive (i.e., it does not include character at index 10 or 79). For each character that appears more than once in this range, the function removes all occurrences of that character from the original string `s`. The resulting altered string is then returned by the function.
