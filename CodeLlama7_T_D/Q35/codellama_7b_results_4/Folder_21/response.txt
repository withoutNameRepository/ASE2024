 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any repeated characters
    new_string = ""

    # Iterate through the characters in s and add them to new_string if they are not repeated between indices 462 and 995
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in new_string or (i >= 462 and i <= 995 and s[i] not in s[i-462:i+1] and s[i] not in s[i+1:i+462])):
            new_string += s[i]

    # Return the altered string
    return new_string
```
