 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function in Python:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the result
    res = ""

    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for i in range(len(s)):

        # If the current character is not already present in the result, add it
        if s[i] not in res:
            res += s[i]

        # If the current character is already present in the result, remove all occurrences of it from the string
        else:
            res = res.replace(s[i], "", 1)

    return res
```
This function takes a single argument `s`, which is a string. It then loops through each character in the input string using a `for` loop, and checks if the current character is already present in the result string. If it is not, it adds the current character to the result string. If it is already present, it removes all occurrences of that character from the string. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
