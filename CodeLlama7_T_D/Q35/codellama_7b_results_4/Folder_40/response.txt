 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a dictionary to keep track of the characters and their indices
    char_dict = {}

    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # If the character is already in the dictionary, add its index to the list of indices
        if c in char_dict:
            char_dict[c].append(i)
        # Otherwise, create a new list with the current index as the only element
        else:
            char_dict[c] = [i]

    # Iterate through each character in the string and check if it appears more than once between the indices 0 and 3
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # If the character appears more than once, remove all occurrences of that character from the string
        if len(char_dict[c]) > 1:
            s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]

    # Return the altered string
    return s
```
