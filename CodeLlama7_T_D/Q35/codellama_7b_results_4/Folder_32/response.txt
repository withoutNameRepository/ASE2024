 ```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the characters from the given string that do not occur more than once between the indices 86 and 90, both exclusive
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in s[86:90]:
            new_string += s[i]
    return new_string
```
This code first creates a new string that is empty. It then iterates over the characters of the given string using a for loop, and checks if each character occurs more than once between the indices 86 and 90, both exclusive. If it does not occur more than once, the function adds that character to the new string. Finally, the function returns the altered new string.
