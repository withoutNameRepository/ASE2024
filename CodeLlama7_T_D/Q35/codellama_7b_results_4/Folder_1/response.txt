 Here's a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string without the repeated characters
    new_str = ""
    for i in range(17, 88):
        if s[i] not in new_str:
            new_str += s[i]
    return new_str
```
This function takes a string `s` as an argument and removes all repeated characters within the indices 17 and 88, exclusive. It does this by creating a new string `new_str` without the repeated characters and returning it at the end of the function.
