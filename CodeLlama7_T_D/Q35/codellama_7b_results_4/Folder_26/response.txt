 Here's a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a list to store the characters in the string
    char_list = []

    # Iterate over the characters in the string
    for i in range(len(s)):

        # Check if the character is already in the list
        if s[i] not in char_list:

            # If it's not, add it to the list and continue
            char_list.append(s[i])

    # Create a new string with the characters from the list
    new_string = ""
    for c in char_list:
        new_string += c

    return new_string
```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. It then creates a list to store the characters in the string, and iterates over the characters using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if it's already in the list of unique characters. If it's not, it adds it to the list and continues. Once all the characters have been added to the list, the function creates a new string with the characters from the list. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
