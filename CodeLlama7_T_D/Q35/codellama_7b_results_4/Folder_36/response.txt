This code uses a dictionary to keep track of the characters in the given string. It then iterates over the string and updates the dictionary accordingly. After updating the dictionary, it iterates over the dictionary and removes any characters that occur more than once between the indices 476 and 709, both exclusive. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
