 ```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Initialize a new empty string
    result = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is not already present in the output string
        if char not in result:
            # Append the current character to the output string
            result += char

    # Return the altered string
    return result
```
This code works by iterating over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if it is already present in the output string `result`. If it is not present, it appends the current character to the output string. This way, we avoid adding any duplicate characters to the output string.
After iterating over all the characters in the input string, the function returns the altered string `result`.
