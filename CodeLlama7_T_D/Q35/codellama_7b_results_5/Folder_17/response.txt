 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any repeated characters
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the current character is not already in the new string, add it
        if s[i] not in new_string:
            new_string += s[i]
    return new_string
```
This function takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string. It then creates a new string `new_string` that has the same characters as `s`, but without any repeated characters. The function does this by iterating over each character in `s` and adding it to `new_string` only if it is not already present in `new_string`. Finally, the function returns the altered string `new_string`.
