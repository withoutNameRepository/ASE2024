 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with all repeated characters removed
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in result:
            result += s[i]
    return result
```
# (modified) 
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. It then iterates over the characters in the given string using a loop, and for each character it checks if it has already been added to the result string. If the character has not already been added, it is added to the end of the result string. The function then returns the altered string.
For example, if we call the `remove_repeat_chars` function with the following argument:
python
s = "hello world"

The function would return the following string:

python
result = "hlowrd"

As you can see, all of the repeated characters in the original string have been removed from the result string.
