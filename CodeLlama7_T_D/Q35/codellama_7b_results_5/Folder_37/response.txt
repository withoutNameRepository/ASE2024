 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the characters from s
    # that occur more than once between indices 2 and 7, exclusive
    new_str = ""
    # Loop through the characters in s
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the current character is repeated
        # more than once between indices 2 and 7, exclusive
        if s[i] == s[i+1]:
            # If it is repeated, remove all occurrences of that character from the string
            new_str += s[:i] + s[i+1:]
    return new_str
```
The function takes a single argument `s`, which is a string. It creates a new string `new_str` with the characters from `s` that occur more than once between indices 2 and 7, exclusive. The loop through the characters in `s` checks if each character is repeated more than once and removes all occurrences of that character from the string if it is repeated. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
