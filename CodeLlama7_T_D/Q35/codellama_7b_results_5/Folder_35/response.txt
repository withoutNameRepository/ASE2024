 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a list of characters in the given string
    char_list = list(s)
    # Iterate over each character in the list
    for i, c in enumerate(char_list):
        # If the current character occurs more than once between indices 77 and 84
        if s.count(c) > 1 and i >= 77 and i < 84:
            # Remove all occurrences of the current character from the string
            char_list = [x for x in char_list if x != c]
    # Return the altered string
    return "".join(char_list)
```
This function first creates a list of characters in the given string using the `list` method. It then iterates over each character in the list, checking if the current character occurs more than once between indices 77 and 84. If it does, the function removes all occurrences of the current character from the string using a list comprehension. Finally, the function returns the altered string by joining the characters back together using the `"".join` method.
