 Here's a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a set to store all unique characters
    unique_chars = set()

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the character is already in the set of unique characters
        if char in unique_chars:
            # Remove all occurrences of the character from the string
            s = s.replace(char, "", 1)

        # Add the character to the set of unique characters
        else:
            unique_chars.add(char)

    # Return the altered string
    return s
```
