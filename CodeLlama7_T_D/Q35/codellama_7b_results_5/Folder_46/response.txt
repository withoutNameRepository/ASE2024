```
This code defines a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes one argument, a string. The function first creates a set of unique characters in the given string. Then it initializes an empty string to store the altered string. It then iterates over each character in the given string and checks if the current character is not in the set of unique characters. If it is not, the function appends the character to the altered string.
The function also checks if the current character is in the set of unique characters and its index is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 79. If it meets this condition, the function removes all occurrences of that character from the string by appending them to the altered string.
Finally, the function returns the altered string.
The function can be tested with a sample input, such as "hello world", and the output should be "hlowrd".
