 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any repeated characters
    result = ""

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] not in result:
            result += s[i]

    return result
```
This function takes a single argument, which is the string to be processed. It then creates a new string that contains all the characters from the original string, but with no repeated characters. This is done by iterating over each character in the original string and checking if it has already been added to the new string. If not, the function adds the character to the end of the new string. The resulting string is then returned by the function.
