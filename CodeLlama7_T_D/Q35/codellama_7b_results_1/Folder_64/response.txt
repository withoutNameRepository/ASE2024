 Here's a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a list of tuples containing the index and character at that index
    indices = [(i, c) for i, c in enumerate(s)]
    # Filter out characters that occur only once
    filtered_indices = [index for index in indices if index[1] not in s[:5]]
    # Create a new string with the filtered characters
    new_string = ''.join([c for i, c in filtered_indices])
    return new_string
```
This code uses list comprehensions to create lists of tuples and filter out characters that occur only once. The resulting list of tuples is then used to create a new string with the desired characters.
