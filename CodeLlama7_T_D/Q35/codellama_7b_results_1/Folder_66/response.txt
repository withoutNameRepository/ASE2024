 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a dictionary to store the counts of each character in the string
    char_counts = {}
    for c in s:
        if c not in char_counts:
            char_counts[c] = 1
        else:
            char_counts[c] += 1
    # Remove all characters that occur more than once between the indices 11 and 76, both exclusive
    for i in range(11, 76):
        c = s[i]
        if char_counts[c] > 1:
            s = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
            break

    return s
```
