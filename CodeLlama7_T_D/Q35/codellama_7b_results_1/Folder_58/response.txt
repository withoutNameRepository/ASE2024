 Here is a possible implementation of the `remove_repeat_chars` function:
```
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a list of characters in the string
    char_list = list(s)
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i, c in enumerate(char_list):
        # If the current character is repeated between indices 103 and 802
        if char_list.index(c) > 103 and char_list.index(c) < 802:
            # Remove all occurrences of the current character from the string
            char_list = [x for x in char_list if x != c]
    return "".join(char_list)
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns an altered version of the string with all repeated characters removed.
