def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the characters removed
    new_str = ''

    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for char in s:

        # If the current character is not already present in the new string
        if char not in new_str:

            # Add the current character to the new string
            new_str += char

# Return the altered string
return new_str
```
This code defines a function called `remove_repeat_chars` that takes one argument, a string. The function iterates over each character in the original string and checks if the current character is not already present in the new string. If it's not, the function adds the current character to the new string while preserving the order of all characters in the string. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
