    # Iterate through each character in the original string
    for char in s:

        # Check if the current character is already in the new string
        if char not in new_string:

```
This function takes a single argument `s` which is the input string. It creates a new string `new_string` with the characters removed as per the requirements. The function then iterates through each character in the original string `s`. If the current character is not already present in the new string, it adds the character to the new string. Finally, the function returns the altered string `new_string`.
