 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_second_smallest_num` function:
```
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    # Check if there are enough elements in the list
    if len(numbers) - 75 < 2:
        return None

    # Find the smallest element in the range
    smallest = float('inf')
    for i in range(75, 89):
        if numbers[i] < smallest:
            second_smallest = smallest
            smallest = numbers[i]
    else:
        return None

    # Return the second smallest element
    return second_smallest
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the list of numbers is large enough to contain at least two elements in the range [75, 89]. If the list is too small, the function will raise an `IndexError`.
