```
This code defines a function called `find_second_smallest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers. The function returns the second smallest element from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return `None`.
The code first checks if the list is empty or has only one element. If it does, the function returns `None`.
Next, the code sorts the list in ascending order using the built-in `sort()` method of lists.
Then, the code loops through each element of the sorted list and checks if the current index is equal to 1. If it is, the function returns the current value of the element at index 1.
#Finally, the code tests the function with the example from the text specification by passing in a list of distinct numbers and printing the result.
