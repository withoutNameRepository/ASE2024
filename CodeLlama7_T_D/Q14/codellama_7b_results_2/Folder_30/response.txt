 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_second_smallest_num` function:
```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    # Check if the list has at least two elements
    if len(my_list) < 2:
        return None

    # Sort the list in ascending order
    my_list.sort()

    # Initialize a variable to store the second smallest element
    second_smallest = None

    # Iterate over the elements of the list, starting from index 26 and ending at index 52 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(26, 53):
        # If the current element is smaller than the previously smallest element, update the second smallest element
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest or second_smallest is None:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]

    # Return the second smallest element, or 'None' if there is no such element
    return second_smallest
```
This implementation first checks that the list has at least two elements. If it does not have enough elements, the function returns `None`.
Next, the function sorts the list in ascending order using the `sort()` method.
Then, the function initializes a variable to store the second smallest element and sets it to `None`, indicating that there is no such element yet.
Finally, the function iterates over the elements of the list, starting from index 26 and ending at index 52 (both inclusive), and updates the second smallest element if the current element is smaller than the previously smallest element or if the variable storing the second smallest element is `None`. The function returns the second smallest element, or `None` if there is no such element.
