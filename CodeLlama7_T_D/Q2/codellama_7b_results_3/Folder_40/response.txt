 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:3]
```
Explanation:

The `all_ints_exclusive` function takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the list of all elements from index 0 to index 2, both exclusive.
The function uses slicing to extract the desired elements from the input list. The slice starts at index 0 and ends before index 3, so it includes all elements up to but not including the third element.
Here is an example of how to use the `all_ints_exclusive` function:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> all_ints_exclusive(my_list)
[1, 2, 3]
```
