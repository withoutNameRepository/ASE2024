 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[6:10]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a list that contains all the elements from index 6 to index 9, both exclusive.
The slicing notation is used to extract a subset of the original list. The syntax for slicing is list_name[start:end], where start and end are integers specifying the bounds of the slice.
In this case, the function returns my_list[6:10], which means that it returns all elements from index 6 to index 9, both exclusive. This is because the slice notation is inclusive on the left side and exclusive on the right side.
