 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[19:94]
```
Explanation:

The `all_ints_exclusive` function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains all elements from index 19 to index 94, both exclusive.
To achieve this, we use the slicing syntax to extract a subset of the original list. The slice `my_list[19:94]` includes all elements from index 19 up to but not including index 94.
By using the `return` statement and returning the new list, we ensure that the function returns the desired output.
