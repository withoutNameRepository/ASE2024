 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[15:40]
```
Explanation:

* The function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is assumed to be a list of integers.
* The function returns the sublist of `my_list` from index 15 (inclusive) to index 40 (exclusive). This will result in the returned sublist containing all elements from index 16 to index 39, inclusive.
