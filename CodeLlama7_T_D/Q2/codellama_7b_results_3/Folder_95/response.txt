 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[44:91]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the sublist that starts from index 44 and ends at index 91, both exclusive. The returned sublist will not include elements from index 44 to index 91, but only their values.
