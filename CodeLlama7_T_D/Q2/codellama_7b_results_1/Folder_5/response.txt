 Here is the code:
```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[2:5]
```
Here is a breakdown of what the code does:
1. The function takes in a list of integers, called `my_list`.
2. The function returns a slice of the original list, starting from index 2 (inclusive) and ending at index 5 (exclusive). This means that the returned list will contain all elements from index 2 to index 5, but it will not include any elements beyond index 5.
3. The function is called `all_ints_exclusive`, which indicates that the function returns a list of all integers in the original list, excluding certain elements.
