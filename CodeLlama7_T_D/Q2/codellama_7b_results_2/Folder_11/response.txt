 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[28:49]
```
Note that this function assumes that the list passed as an argument has at least 28 elements, and it returns a slice of those elements from index 28 to index 49. If the list does not have enough elements, or if you want to modify the indices of the returned slice, you will need to modify this code accordingly.
