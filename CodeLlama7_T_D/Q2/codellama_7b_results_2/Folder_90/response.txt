def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[364:585]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sublist that starts at index 364 and ends before index 585. The colon (:) in the slice notation indicates that the second index is exclusive, meaning it will not include the element at index 585.
