 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[20:36]
```
This code creates a function called `all_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function then uses slicing to extract the elements from index 20 to index 36, both exclusive. Finally, the function returns the extracted elements.
