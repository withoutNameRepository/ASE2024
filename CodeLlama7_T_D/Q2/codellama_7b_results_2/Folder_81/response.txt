def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[10:100]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_exclusive` takes a list of integers as its argument, and returns the list of elements from index 10 to index 100, both exclusive.
To achieve this, we use slicing to extract the desired sublist from the original list. The slice indices are `[10:100]`, which means that we start at index 10 and end at index 99, both exclusive.
