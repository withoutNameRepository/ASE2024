 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[15:99]
```
Explanation:
The `all_ints_exclusive` function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of all elements from index 15 to index 99, both exclusive.
The slicing operation is performed using the `[start:stop:step]` syntax, where `start` is the starting index (inclusive), `stop` is the stopping index (exclusive), and `step` is the step size (defaults to 1).
Therefore, in this case, the function returns all elements from the list that are at indices 15 to 98, both inclusive.
