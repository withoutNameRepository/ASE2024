 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:10]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the first 10 elements of that list, excluding the last element. This is done by using slicing to extract the desired portion of the list. The slice `[:10]` returns all elements up to (but not including) index 10.
