def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[10:79]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_exclusive` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the slice of the list from index 10 to index 79, both exclusive. This is achieved by using the slicing syntax `[start:end]` where `start` and `end` are the starting and ending indices, respectively. The `:` in this case represents the step size between indices, which is set to `1` by default. Since we want to exclude index 10 and 79, we specify the start index as 11 and the end index as 80.
