 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:6]
```
Here is the explanation of the code:
The function `all_ints_exclusive` takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 0 to index 5, both exclusive.
The code uses slicing to extract the desired subset of the input list. Slicing allows us to specify a range of indices, which are then used to create a new list with the specified elements. In this case, we use the syntax `[:6]` to indicate that we want the first six elements of the input list. The `[:6]` notation is equivalent to writing `list[0:6]`.
The function returns the resulting list of integers.
