Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_exclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 473 to index 743, both exclusive.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
