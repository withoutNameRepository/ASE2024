 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[50:200]
```
Explanation:

The function `all_ints_exclusive` takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the list of all elements from index 50 to index 200, both exclusive.
To achieve this, we use slicing notation to extract the sublist starting at index 50 and ending before index 200. The `:` is used to indicate that the slice should be excluded.
For example, if we have a list of integers `my_list = [1, 2, 3, ..., 99, 100]`, then the expression `my_list[50:200]` would give us the sublist `[51, 52, ..., 198, 199]`.
Note that we start the slice at index 50, which is exclusive, and end it before index 200, which is also exclusive. This gives us the sublist of all elements from index 50 to index 200, both exclusive.
