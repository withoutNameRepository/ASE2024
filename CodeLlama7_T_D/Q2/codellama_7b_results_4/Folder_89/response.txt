 ```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[20:51]
```
Explanation:

The function `all_ints_exclusive` takes a single argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 20 to index 51, both exclusive.
To achieve this, we use slicing notation to extract the desired sublist from the original list. We start by indexing the list at position 20 with `my_list[20]` and then end the slice at position 51 with `my_list[51]`.
By using the colon (`:`) separator between the starting index and ending index, we create a range of indices that we can use to extract the desired sublist.
