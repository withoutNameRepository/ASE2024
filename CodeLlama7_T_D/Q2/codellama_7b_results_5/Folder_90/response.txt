 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_exclusive` function:
```
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[364:585]
```
This code takes a single argument, which should be a list of integers. It then uses slicing to extract the elements from index 364 to index 585, both exclusive. The resulting sublist is returned by the function.
