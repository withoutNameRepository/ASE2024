 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create an empty string for the filtered output
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for c in s:
        # Check if the current character is within the specified range
        if (ord(c) >= ord('O')) and (ord(c) <= ord('d')):
            # If it is, do not include it in the filtered output
            continue

        else:
            # Otherwise, add the current character to the filtered output
            filtered += c

    return filtered
```
