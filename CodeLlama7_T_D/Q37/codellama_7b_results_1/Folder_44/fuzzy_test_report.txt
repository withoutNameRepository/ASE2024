Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['   2h7 K  8k8z8h09H3 lFq3sZYP D &2B1h9dR=V90&s>6eY=$x8r9C> 99U 3f 7 >04&=70>c>$76&1S%%5B=2']

The correct answer was:
   h7 K  8k8z8h9H lFqsZYP D &Bh9dR=V9&s>6eY=$x8r9C> 99U f 7 >4&=7>c>$76&S%%5B=

But the LLM code returned:
   h K  kzh9H lFqsZYP D &Bh9dR=V9&s>eY=$xr9C> 99U f  >&=>c>$&S%%B=
