 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(string):
    # Find all characters between indices 24 and 82, inclusive
    char_range = string[24:83]
    # Remove all occurrences of any character in the range '5' to '<', both inclusive
    filtered_string = "".join(char for char in string if char not in char_range)
    return filtered_string
```
