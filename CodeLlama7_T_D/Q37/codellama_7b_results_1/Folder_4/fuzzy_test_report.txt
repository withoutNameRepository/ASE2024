(1) With the following counter example:
['$9>7 05 6 =0h8K798s ZfY>Dl&S8B02Rhh4V&  Uzr9q F8 eY%c95$H@7Ps 3%0216+  7d%>5  ']

The correct answer was:
$9>7 05 6 =08K798s >D&8B02R4V&  Uzr9q F8 e%c95$H@7Ps 3%0216+  7d%>5  

But the LLM code returned:
$9>7 05 6 =08K798 >D&8B02R4&  9 F8 %95$H@7P 3%0216+  7%>5
