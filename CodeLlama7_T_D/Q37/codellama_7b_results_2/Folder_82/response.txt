 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # If the current character is between indices 12 and 25, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character 'P' and smaller than or equal to character 'x', then remove it from the filtered string
        if (i >= 12 and i <= 25) and (s[i] >= "P" and s[i] <= "x"):
            continue

        # Otherwise, append the current character to the filtered string
        else:
            filtered += s[i]

    # Return the filtered string
    return filtered
```
