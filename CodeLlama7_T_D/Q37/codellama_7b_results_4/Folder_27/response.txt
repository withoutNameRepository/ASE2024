 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the filtered characters
    new_string = ""

    # Iterate over the characters in the original string
    for char in s:

        # Check if the character is between indices 43 and 80, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character '=' and smaller than or equal to character 'E'
        if (char >= '=' and char <= 'E') and (43 <= char < 81):

            # If the character is in this range, do not include it in the new string
            continue

        # Otherwise, include the character in the new string
        new_string += char

    return new_string
```
This code first creates a new string with the filtered characters. It then iterates over the characters in the original string using a `for` loop. For each character, it checks if the character is between indices 43 and 80, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character '=' and smaller than or equal to character 'E'. If the character is not in this range, it includes the character in the new string. Otherwise, it skips the character using the `continue` statement. Finally, it returns the altered string.
