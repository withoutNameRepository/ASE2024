    filtered_string = ""
    for i in range(len(my_string)):
        if i >= start_index and i <= end_index:
            current_char = my_string[i]

```
This code defines a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string. It then uses a for loop to iterate through each character of the given string. For each character, it checks whether the index is between 15 and 55 (both inclusive), and if the character is greater than or equal to "W" and smaller than or equal to "{". If this condition is met, then the current character is removed from the filtered string.
Once all characters that do not meet the specified criteria have been removed, the function returns the altered string as the filtered result.
