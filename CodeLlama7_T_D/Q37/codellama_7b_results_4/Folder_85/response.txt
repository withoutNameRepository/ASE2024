This code defines a function `filter_chars` that takes a single argument, a string. The function iterates over each character in the given string and checks if it is within the specified range (28-65) and meets the condition (`char >= "O" and char <= "d"`). If the current character does not meet these conditions, the function appends it to an empty string that stores the filtered characters. Finally, the function returns the filtered string.
