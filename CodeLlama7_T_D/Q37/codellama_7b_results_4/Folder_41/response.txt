 Here's a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(string):
    # Split the string into a list of characters
    char_list = list(string)
    # Iterate over the characters in the list
    for i in range(len(char_list)):
        # Check if the current character is between indices 26 and 64, both inclusive
        if (i >= 26 and i <= 64) and char_list[i] == 'o':
            # If so, remove all occurrences of that character from the list
            while char_list.count(char_list[i]) > 0:
                index = char_list.index(char_list[i])
                char_list.pop(index)
    # Join the characters in the list back into a string
    filtered_string = "".join(char_list)
    return filtered_string
```
