 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create an empty list to store the filtered characters
    filtered_chars = []

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is not between indices 42 and 92, inclusive
        if (char < 'a' or char > 'z') and (char < 'A' or char > 'Z'):
            # Append the current character to the filtered characters list
            filtered_chars.append(char)
    # Join the filtered characters list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(filtered_chars)
```
