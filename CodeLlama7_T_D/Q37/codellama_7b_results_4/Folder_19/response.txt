 ```
def filter_chars(string):
    filtered_string = ""
    for i in range(35, 90):
        char = string[i]
        if (char >= "E" and char <= "t"):
            continue

        filtered_string += char

    return filtered_string
```
This code uses a combination of slicing and string concatenation to remove all occurrences of characters between indices 35 and 89, inclusive, that are greater than or equal to "E" and smaller than or equal to "t", while preserving the order of all other characters in the input string.
