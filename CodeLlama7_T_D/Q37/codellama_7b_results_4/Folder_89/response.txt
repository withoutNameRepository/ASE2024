 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:

        # If the current character is between indices 11 and 32, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to '!' and smaller than or equal to '@', then remove all occurrences of that character from the input string
        if (char >= "!" and char <= "@") and (char >= s[11] and char <= s[32])):
            filtered += char.lower()

    # Return the altered string with the filtered characters removed
    return filtered
```
