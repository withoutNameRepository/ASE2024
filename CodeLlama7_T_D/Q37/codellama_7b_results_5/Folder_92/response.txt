 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ''

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is between indices 4 and 4, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character '7' and smaller than or equal to character 'o', then remove all occurrences of that character from the input string
        if (char >= '7') and (char <= 'o'):
            filtered = filtered.replace(char, '')

    # Return the altered string
    return filtered
```
In this code, we first initialize an empty string `filtered` to store the filtered characters. Then, we iterate over each character in the input string using a for loop. If the current character is between indices 4 and 4, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character '7' and smaller than or equal to character 'o', then we remove all occurrences of that character from the input string by replacing it with an empty string. Finally, we return the altered string.
