 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ''

    # Iterate over each character in the given string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is between indices 513 and 877, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to '?' and smaller than or equal to 'n', then append it to the filtered string
        if (513 <= len(filtered) + 1 <= 877) and ('?' <= char <= 'n'):
            filtered += char
    # Return the altered string
    return filtered
```
