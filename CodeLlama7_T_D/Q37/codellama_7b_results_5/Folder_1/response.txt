 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for c in s:
        # If the current character is between indices 41 and 79, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to 'f' and smaller than or equal to '|', then remove all occurrences of that character from the input string
        if (40 < len(filtered) + 1 < 80) and ((ord('f') <= ord(c)) and (ord(c) <= ord('|')))):
            filtered = filtered.replace(c, "")
        else:
            filtered += c

    return filtered
```
Note that this code uses the `ord()` function to convert characters to their ASCII values, and the `<=` operator to check if a character is between two other characters. It also uses the `replace()` method of strings to remove occurrences of specific characters from the input string.
