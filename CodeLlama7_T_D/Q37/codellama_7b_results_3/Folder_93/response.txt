 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(string):
    # Create a new string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in string:
        # If the current character is not between indices 38 and 69, inclusive, or if it does not meet the other conditions, add it to the filtered string
        if (char.isalpha() or char.isdigit()) and (char != "H" and char != "e"):
            filtered += char

    # Return the filtered string
    return filtered
```
This implementation uses a combination of Python's built-in `str` methods (`isalpha()`, `isdigit()`) and logical operators (`and`) to determine which characters should be included in the filtered string. It then iterates over each character in the input string, adding only those that meet the criteria to the filtered string. Finally, it returns the filtered string.
