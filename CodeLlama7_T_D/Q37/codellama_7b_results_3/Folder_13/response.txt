 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a list of all characters in the string
    char_list = list(s)
    # Iterate over each character in the list
    for i in range(len(char_list)):
        # If the current character is between indices 124 and 854, both inclusive
        if (i >= 124 and i <= 854) and (char_list[i] >= '9' and char_list[i] <= 's'):
            # Remove all occurrences of the current character from the list
            while char_list.count(char_list[i]) > 0:
                char_list.remove(char_list[i])
    # Return the altered string
    return "".join(char_list)
```
