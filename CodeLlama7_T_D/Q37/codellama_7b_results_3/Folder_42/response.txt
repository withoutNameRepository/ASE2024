 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Loop through each character in the input string
    for c in s:
        # If the current character is between indices 73 and 74, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character 'U' and smaller than or equal to character 'l', then remove all occurrences of that character from the filtered string
        if (73 <= ord(c) <= 74) and ('U' <= c <= 'l'):
            continue

        # Otherwise, add the current character to the filtered string
        else:
            filtered += c

    # Return the filtered string
    return filtered
```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. The function first initializes an empty string to store the filtered characters. Then it loops through each character in the input string using a for loop. For each character, the function checks if the current character is between indices 73 and 74, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character 'U' and smaller than or equal to character 'l'. If this condition is met, then the function removes all occurrences of that character from the filtered string. Otherwise, the function adds the current character to the filtered string. Finally, the function returns the filtered string.
