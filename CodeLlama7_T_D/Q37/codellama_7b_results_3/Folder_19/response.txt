    # Iterate over the characters between indices 35 and 89, inclusive
    for i in range(35, 90):
        # If the current character is greater than or equal to 'E' and smaller than or equal to 't', remove it from the string
        if char_list[i] >= 'E' and char_list[i] <= 't':

```
This code defines a function `filter_chars` that takes a single argument, a string. The function creates a list of characters in the input string and then iterates over the characters between indices 35 and 89 (inclusive). If the current character is greater than or equal to 'E' and smaller than or equal to 't', the function removes it from the string. Finally, the function returns the altered string as a single string object.
