 Here is a possible implementation of the filter_chars function:
```
def filter_chars(string):
    filtered_string = ""
    for i in range(46, 85+1):
        if string[i] >= "-" and string[i] <= "X":
            continue

        else:

            filtered_string += string[i]

    return filtered_string
```
This implementation uses a for loop to iterate over the characters in the input string. For each character, it checks whether it should be removed based on the given conditions. If the character should be removed, the function continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the character should not be removed, it is added to the filtered_string variable. Finally, the function returns the filtered_string variable.
