 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ''

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for c in s:
        # If the current character is between indices 28 and 65, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to 'O' and smaller than or equal to 'd', then append it to the filtered string
        if (28 <= ord(c) <= 65) and ('O' <= c <= 'd'):
            filtered += c

    # Return the filtered string

    return filtered
```
This code works by iterating over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if it is between indices 28 and 65, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to 'O' and smaller than or equal to 'd'. If the condition is true, then the character is appended to the filtered string.
Finally, the function returns the filtered string.
