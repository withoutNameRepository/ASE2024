def insert_after_index(my_list):
    new_list = my_list[:]
    for i in range(len(my_list)):

```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_index` that takes one argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical except that 8 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 2 and, as a result, the returned list should have one more element than the given list. The function first creates a copy of the input list using slicing. Then it iterates over the elements of the input list, if it finds an element equal to 2, it inserts the value 8 at the index immediately succeeding the current index. Finally, the function returns the modified list as the result of its execution.
