def insert_after_index(my_list):
    new_list = my_list[:]
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if i == 100:
            new_list.insert(i+1, [876, 203])
    return new_list
```
This function takes a list as input and returns a new list with the same elements except that `[876, 203]` has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index `100`. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.
