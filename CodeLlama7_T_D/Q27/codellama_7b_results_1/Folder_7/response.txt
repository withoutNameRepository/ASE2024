 ```
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    # Find the index of the next element after 323
    idx = my_list.index(323) + 1
    # Insert [389, 303] at the found index
    my_list.insert(idx, [389, 303])
    return my_list
```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_index` that takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the same elements as the original list except for the element at index 323 which is replaced by the list `[389, 303]`. The function first finds the index of the next element after 323 using the `index` method of lists. It then inserts the new list `[389, 303]` at that index in the original list using the `insert` method of lists. Finally, the function returns the modified list.
