 ```
def insert_after_index(my_list):
return my_list[:57] + [76] + my_list[57:]
```
This function takes a list as input, and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that the element at index 57 has been replaced by 76. The resulting list should have one more element than the original list, because we are inserting a new element at the index immediately succeeding index 57.
