 ```
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    new_list = []
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] == 89:
            new_list.extend(my_list[:i+1])
            new_list.append(86)
            new_list.extend(my_list[i+1:])
    return new_list
```
This code uses a loop to iterate through the elements of the input list. For each element, it checks if it is equal to 89. If it is, then it inserts 86 at the next index after the current index (i.e., i+1). It also extends the new list with the remaining elements of the original list that come after the inserted index.
The code first creates an empty list to store the modified values. Then, it iterates through each element of the input list using a for loop. For each element, it checks if it is equal to 89. If it is, then it inserts 86 at the next index after the current index (i.e., i+1). It also extends the new list with the remaining elements of the original list that come after the inserted index.
The code then returns the modified list with the inserted value.
