 Here is a possible implementation of the `insert_after_index` function:
```python
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    new_list = my_list[:]
    for i in range(len(new_list)):
        if new_list[i] == 42:
            new_list.insert(i+1, 53)
    return new_list
```
This function takes a list as input and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that 53 has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 42.
