 ```
def insert_after_index(my_list):
return my_list[:91] + [46, 13] + my_list[91:]
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_after_index` takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the element `[46, 13]` inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 91. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.
The function achieves this by using slicing to extract the sublists from the original list. It then concatenates these sublists with the new element `[46, 13]` inserted at the appropriate index.
Note that this solution assumes that the input list has at least one element beyond the index specified in the problem statement (i.e., `my_list[91:]` is non-empty). If the input list is empty or has no elements beyond the specified index, then the function will raise an IndexError when it tries to access the sublist at that index.
