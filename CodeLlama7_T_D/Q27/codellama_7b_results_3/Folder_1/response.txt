 ```
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    # Find the index of the item to insert after
    insert_after_index = my_list.index(33) + 1
    # Insert the new item at the found index
    my_list.insert(insert_after_index, [33, 78])
    return my_list
```
This function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that [33, 78] has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index 93. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.
