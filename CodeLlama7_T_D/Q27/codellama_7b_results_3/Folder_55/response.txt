def insert_after_index(my_list):

    try:
        index = my_list.index(141.02) # find the index of the element to be inserted
        new_list.insert(index+1, 141.02) # insert the element at the next index

```
This function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list with the element `141.02` inserted immediately after the index of the first occurrence of this element in the original list. If the element is not found in the original list, then the returned list will be identical to the original list.
