 Here is a possible implementation of the `insert_after_index` function:
```python
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    new_list = my_list[:28] + [41, 69] + my_list[28:]
    return new_list

# Example usage of the function
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]
# (modified) new_list = insert_after_index(my_list)
#print(new_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 41, 69, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]
```
This code uses the `my_list[:28]` syntax to get a copy of the original list up to index 28. It then appends the `[41, 69]` list to this copy using the `+` operator. Finally, it uses the `my_list[28:]` syntax to get a copy of the original list starting from index 28 and appends that copy to the modified copy of the original list using the `+` operator.
