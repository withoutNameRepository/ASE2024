 ```
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    # Create a new list with the same elements as my_list
    new_list = []
    # Loop through each element in my_list
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        # Add the current element to the new list
        new_list.append(my_list[i])
        # If we are at index 370, insert 285.4 after it
        if i == 370:
            new_list.insert(i + 1, 285.4)
    return new_list
```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_index` that takes a single argument, a list, and returns a list with the same elements as the input list, but with an additional element inserted after index 370. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.
