 ```
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    new_list = my_list[:] # make a copy of the list
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if i == 4:
            new_list.insert(i+1, 856.69)
    return new_list
```
This code defines a function `insert_after_index` that takes a single argument of type list and returns a new list identical to the original except with an additional element inserted at the index immediately succeeding the index equal to 4. The newly created list should have one more element than the given list, which is why we use the `.insert()` method in our for loop to add the new element to the returned list.
