def insert_after_index(my_list):
return my_list[:31] + [88, 51] + my_list[31:]
```
This function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the original except that `[88, 51]` has been inserted at the index immediately succeeding index `31`. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.
