 Here's a possible implementation of the `all_right_truncatable_prime` function:
```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple_of_positive_integers):
    # Get the integer at index 70 from the tuple
    x = tuple_of_positive_integers[70]
    # Initialize an empty list to store the right-truncatable prime numbers less than x
    list_of_right_truncatable_prime_numbers = []
    # Iterate over all prime numbers less than x
    for i in range(2, x):
        # Check if the current prime number is a right-truncatable prime number
        if is_right_truncatable_prime(i):
            # If the current prime number is a right-truncatable prime number, add it to the list of right-truncatable prime numbers less than x
            list_of_right_truncatable_prime_numbers.append(i)
    # Sort the list of right-truncatable prime numbers in descending order
    list_of_right_truncatable_prime_numbers = sorted(list_of_right_truncatable_prime_numbers, reverse=True)
    return list_of_right_truncatable_prime_numbers
```
This code first gets the integer at index 70 from the tuple passed as an argument. It then initializes an empty list to store all the right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. It iterates over all prime numbers less than x and checks if each prime number is a right-truncatable prime number using the `is_right_truncatable_prime` function. If a prime number is a right-truncatable prime number, it adds the prime number to the list of right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. Finally, it sorts the list of right-truncatable prime numbers in descending order and returns the sorted list.
