This code defines a function `all_right_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as its argument. It then extracts the integer at index 100 from the tuple, which is assumed to be less than x. The function then iterates over all numbers between 2 and x-1 (inclusive), checking if each number is prime and right truncatable. If a right truncatable prime number is found, it is added to a list of prime numbers. Finally, the sorted list of prime numbers is returned in descending order.
The `is_prime` function checks if an integer is prime by iterating over all numbers between 2 and n/2 (inclusive), checking if each number divides n without leaving a remainder. If no such number is found, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
The `right_truncatable_prime` function checks if an integer is right truncatable by iterating over all numbers between 2 and n/2 (inclusive), checking if each number divides n without leaving a remainder. If no such number is found, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
This code should generate one solution for the given problem statement.
