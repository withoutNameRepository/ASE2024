#This code defines a function called `all_right_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. The function then goes on to define three more functions: `is_prime`, `right_truncatable_prime`, and `print`.
The `is_prime` function checks whether the number passed to it is prime or not. It does this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number, and checking if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it must be a prime number.
The `right_truncatable_prime` function checks whether a number is a right-truncatable prime number or not. It does this by iterating from the last digit of the number to the first digit, and checking if the number remains prime when each of these digits are removed. If the number is always prime when any of these digits are removed, then it must be a right-truncatable prime number.
The `all_right_truncatable_prime` function first checks whether the input tuple contains at least one positive integer. If it does not contain any such integers, then the function returns an empty list, as there are no right-truncatable prime numbers less than any of these integers.
If the input tuple contains at least one positive integer, then the function iterates through each number in the tuple and checks if it is a right-truncatable prime number using the `right_truncatable_prime` function defined above. If the number is a right-truncatable prime number, then it is added to the list of prime numbers returned by the function.
Once all the numbers in the input tuple have been checked for whether they are right-truncatable prime numbers or not, the function returns the sorted list of prime numbers. If there are no prime numbers that meet the criteria defined above, then the function returns an empty list.
#Finally, the `print` statement at the end of the code prints out the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than 20, which is [13, 17].
