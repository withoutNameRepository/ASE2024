 Here's the Python code for the given function:
```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(num):
    x = num[81]
    prime_numbers = []

    for i in range(2, x):
        if is_prime(i):
            if right_truncatable_prime(i):
                prime_numbers.append(i)

    return sorted(prime_numbers, reverse=True)
```
Note that this code uses a function called `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, and it uses another function called `right_truncatable_prime` to check if a number is right-truncatable prime. Both of these functions are defined elsewhere in the code and can be found by searching for them in the documentation or online resources.
