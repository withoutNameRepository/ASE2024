This code uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`, which is the 28th element in the input tuple. The function first checks if the number is prime and then checks if it is right-truncatable prime by repeatedly removing the last rightmost digit until the number becomes 1. If the number is a right-truncatable prime, it is added to the list of numbers. Finally, the list of numbers is sorted in ascending order and returned as the output.
