def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple):
# x is the integer at index 975 in the tuple
x = tuple[975]
# list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x
list = []
for i in range(2, x):
if i % 2 == 0 or i % 3 == 0: continue
j = i
while j > 0:
if j % 10 == 0: break
j //= 10
if j < 10 and is_prime(j): list.append(j)
return sorted(list, reverse=True)
```
This code uses the `tuple` argument to get the value of `x`, which is the integer at index 975 in the tuple. It then uses a for loop to iterate through all the numbers less than `x` and checks if they are right-truncatable prime numbers. If they are, they are added to the list of right-truncatable prime numbers. The list is then sorted in descending order and returned by the function.
