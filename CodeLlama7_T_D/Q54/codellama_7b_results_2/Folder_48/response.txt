def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple):

```
This code defines a function called `all_right_truncatable_prime` that takes an argument of type tuple. The function then extracts the integer at index 835 from the tuple and stores it in the variable `x`.
The function then initializes an empty list to store all the right-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`. It then iterates over the range of integers from 2 to `x` (exclusive) using a for loop, and checks if each integer is a prime number and remains prime when the last rightmost digit is successively removed. If the current integer is a right-truncatable prime number, it is appended to the list.
Finally, the function sorts the list of right-truncatable prime numbers in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and returns the sorted list.
