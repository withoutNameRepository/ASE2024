 ```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple):
	x = tuple[28]
	# list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x
	all_primes = []
	for i in range(10, x):
		if is_prime(i):
			all_primes.append(i)
	return sorted(all_primes)
```
This code uses a function called `is_prime` to check if a number is prime or not. If the number is prime, then it is added to the list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. Finally, the list is sorted in ascending order and returned by the function.
