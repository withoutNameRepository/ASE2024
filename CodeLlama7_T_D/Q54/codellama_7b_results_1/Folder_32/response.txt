 Here's the code:
```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple):
    x = tuple[42]
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(1,x-1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_right_truncatable_prime(i,x):
            prime_numbers.append(i)
    return sorted(prime_numbers)

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False

    for i in range(2,int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False

    return True

def is_right_truncatable_prime(n,x):
    for i in range(1,len(str(n))-1):
        if str(n)[i:] != str(n)[1:]:
            return False

    return n < x
```
The function `all_right_truncatable_prime` takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. It then extracts the integer at index 42 in the tuple, which is assumed to be a prime number. The function then generates all right-truncatable prime numbers less than the extracted prime number and returns them sorted in ascending order.
The function `is_prime` checks if an integer is prime by iterating from 2 up to its square root (inclusive) and checking if it is divisible by any of those numbers. If no such number exists, the integer is assumed to be prime.
The function `is_right_truncatable_prime` checks if an integer is a right-truncatable prime number by iterating from 1 up to the length of its string representation minus 1 (inclusive) and checking if the resulting string representations are equal to each other. If all such iterations result in the same string, then the integer is assumed to be a right-truncatable prime number.
The code does not generate any duplicates, as each integer is only checked once using the `is_right_truncatable_prime` function.
