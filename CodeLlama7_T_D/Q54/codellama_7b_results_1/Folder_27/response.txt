for i in range(2, x):

```
Explanation:
The function takes a tuple of positive integers as input. It extracts the 79th element from the tuple and assigns it to the variable `x`.
Then, it iterates through the range of numbers from 2 to `x`, checking if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function (which we will define later) and if it is right-truncatable prime using the `is_right_truncatable_prime` function (which we will also define later).
If a number is both prime and right-truncatable prime, it is added to the list of right-truncatable prime numbers.
Finally, the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than `x` is returned. If there are no such numbers, an empty list is returned.
