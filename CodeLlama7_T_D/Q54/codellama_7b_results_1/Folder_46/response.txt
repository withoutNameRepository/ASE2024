 Here's a possible implementation of the `all_right_truncatable_prime` function:
```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple):
    x = tuple[33]
    prime_numbers = []

    for i in range(1, x):
        if is_prime(i) and right_truncate(i) == i:
            prime_numbers.append(i)

    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
This function takes a tuple as input, which contains at least 34 elements. The function then extracts the integer at index 33 (zero-based indexing), and uses it to determine the maximum value of the prime numbers to be searched for.
The function then iterates over the range of integers from 1 to x, and checks each number to see if it is a prime number that remains prime when its last rightmost digit is successively removed. If such a prime number exists, the function adds it to the list of prime numbers to be returned.
Finally, the function returns the sorted list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than x. If there are no such prime numbers, the function returns an empty list.
