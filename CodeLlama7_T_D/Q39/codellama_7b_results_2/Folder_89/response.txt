 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_n_greatest_chars` function:
```python
def return_n_greatest_chars(s, n):
    # Create a list of tuples containing the character and its ASCII value
    chars = [(c, ord(c)) for c in s]
    # Sort the list in descending order based on the ASCII values
    sorted_chars = sorted(chars, key=lambda x: -x[1])
    # Return the top n characters from the sorted list
    return [c[0] for c in sorted_chars[:n]]
```
This function takes two arguments: `s`, a string of distinct characters, and `n`, an integer representing the number of greatest characters to return. It first creates a list of tuples containing each character in `s` along with its ASCII value. It then sorts this list in descending order based on the ASCII values using the `sorted` function. Finally, it returns the top `n` characters from the sorted list.
