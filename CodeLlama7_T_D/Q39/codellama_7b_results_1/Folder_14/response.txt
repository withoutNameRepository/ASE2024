This function takes two arguments: a string `s` of distinct characters, and an integer `n` representing the number of greatest characters to be returned.
The function first creates a list of tuples containing the character and its ASCII value for each character in the input string. It then sorts this list by the ASCII values in descending order using the `sort()` method.
Finally, the function returns the top `n` characters from the sorted list, which are the greatest ASCII values among all the characters in the input string.
