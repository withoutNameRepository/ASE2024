 ```
def return_n_greatest_chars(string, n=64):
    # Sort the characters of the string in descending order based on their ASCII values
    sorted_chars = sorted(string, key=ord, reverse=True)
    # Return the top 'n' characters from the sorted list
    return sorted_chars[:n]
```
This code defines a function `return_n_greatest_chars` that takes two arguments: `string`, which is a string of distinct characters; and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of greatest characters to be returned. The function first sorts the characters of the input string in descending order based on their ASCII values using the `sorted()` function with a custom sorting key of `ord`. It then returns the top `n` characters from the sorted list, where `n` is the value passed as the `n` argument to the function.
