 ```
def return_n_greatest_chars(s):
return sorted(s, key=lambda x: ord(x), reverse=True)[:3]
```
Explanation:

The `ord()` function returns the ASCII value of a character. We use this function to sort the characters in descending order based on their ASCII values. The `reverse=True` argument tells Python to sort the list in descending order.
We then take the first three elements of the sorted list and return them as the output of the function.
Note: The solution assumes that the input string contains at least 3 distinct characters. If this assumption is not met, the function will raise an error when trying to access the non-existent fourth element of the list.
