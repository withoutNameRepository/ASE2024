    char_list = [(char, ord(char)) for char in string]
    # Sort the list by the ASCII value in descending order

```
This code defines a function called `return_n_greatest_chars` that takes two arguments: `string`, which is a string of distinct characters, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of characters to return. The function first creates a list of tuples containing each character in the input string along with its corresponding ASCII value. It then sorts this list by the ASCII value in descending order using the `sorted` function. Finally, it returns the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which will be the `n` greatest characters in the input string according to their ASCII values.
