This function takes a string of distinct characters as input and returns a sorted list of exactly 45 characters of the given string that have the greatest ASCII values. The function first converts the input string to a list of individual characters. It then sorts the list in descending order based on the ASCII value of each character. Finally, it returns the top 45 characters from the sorted list.
