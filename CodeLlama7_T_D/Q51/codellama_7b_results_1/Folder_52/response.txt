def if_contains_anagrams(my_list):
    # Count the number of pairs of anagrams in the list
    num_pairs = 0
    for i in range(len(my_list) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(my_list))):
            if sorted(my_list[i]) == sorted(my_list[j])):
                num_pairs += 1
    return num_pairs <= 43
```
This code uses the `sorted` function to sort each string in the list, and then checks if the sorted strings are equal. If they are equal, it means that the two strings have the same letters in the same order, which is an anagram. The `num_pairs` variable keeps track of the number of pairs of anagrams found in the list.
The function first iterates over all possible pairs of strings in the list using a nested loop. For each pair, it checks if the two strings are anagrams by sorting them and comparing the sorted lists. If the two strings are not anagrams, the inner loop moves on to the next pair.
Once the outer loop has completed, the function returns `True` if the number of pairs of anagrams found in the list is at most 43, or `False` otherwise.
This code uses a case-insensitive comparison to check if two strings are anagrams. This means that the function will consider both "apple" and "Apple" to be anagrams of each other.
