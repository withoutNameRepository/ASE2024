                anagram_count += 1

```
This code uses a nested loop to compare every string with every other string. If two strings are anagrams of each other, they will be considered as one pair. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the letters in both strings in alphabetical order, and then we can easily compare them.
The function first counts the number of anagrams in the list by using a nested loop. If there are at most 79 pairs of anagrams in the list, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
Note that this code only considers the anagrams of the English letters and the length of at least three.
