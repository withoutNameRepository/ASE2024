def if_contains_anagrams(words):
    anagram_pairs = 0
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(words)):
            if sorted(words[i].lower()) == sorted(words[j].lower()):
                anagram_pairs += 1
                if anagram_pairs > 65:
                    return False

    return True
```
Note that this code uses the `sorted()` function to compare the letters in each word, regardless of their case. This is a more efficient approach than using the `lower()` method on each word individually, as it reduces the number of comparisons required from O(n^2) to O(n log n), where n is the length of the list of words.
