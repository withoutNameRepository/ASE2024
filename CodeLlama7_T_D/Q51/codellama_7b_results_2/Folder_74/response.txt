 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_contains_anagrams` function:
```
def if_contains_anagrams(my_list):
    # Initialize variables
    anagram_count = 0
    minimum_length = 3

    # Iterate over the list and check for anagrams
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(my_list))):
            # Check if the current string is an anagram of the previous one
            if sorted(my_list[j].lower()) == sorted(my_list[i].lower()):
                # If it is an anagram, increase the anagram count
                anagram_count += 1

    # Return True if there are at most 57 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, return False
    return anagram_count <= 57
```
This implementation first initializes three variables: `anagram_count`, which keeps track of the number of anagram pairs found; `minimum_length`, which is set to 3 to ensure that the strings being compared have a minimum length; and `my_list`, which is the input list of strings.
Next, the implementation iterates over the elements in the `my_list` list using two nested for loops. The outer loop iterates over each element in the `my_list` list, while the inner loop iterates over each element after the current one in the `my_list` list.
Inside the inner loop, the implementation checks if the current string is an anagram of the previous one using the `sorted()` function to sort the characters in both strings and compare them directly. If they are anagrams, the `anagram_count` variable is increased by 1.
Finally, the implementation returns `True` if there are at most 57 pairs of anagrams in the given list; otherwise, it returns `False`.
