```
Explanation:
The function first initializes a counter variable `anagram_count` to keep track of the number of anagrams in the list.
It then iterates through the list, starting at the first element and ending at the second-last element. For each pair of elements, it checks if they are anagrams by comparing their sorted values. If they are, the counter is incremented by 1.
Finally, the function returns `True` if the number of anagram pairs in the list is less than or equal to 78, and `False` otherwise.
