```
This code defines a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes a single argument, a list of strings. The function returns `True` if there are at most 65 pairs of anagrams in the given list, and `False` otherwise.
The function works by first getting the number of elements in the list using the `len()` function. It then initializes a counter for the number of anagrams found to be zero.
Next, the function loops through each element in the list using a `for` loop. For each element, it checks if the current element is a palindrome by comparing it with its own reverse. If the current element is a palindrome, the function increments the number of anagrams found by one.
Finally, the function returns whether there are at most 65 pairs of anagrams in the given list based on the value of the counter.
