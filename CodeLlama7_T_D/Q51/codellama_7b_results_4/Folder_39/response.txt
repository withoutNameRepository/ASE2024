 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_contains_anagrams` function:
```python
def if_contains_anagrams(lst):
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the frequency of each letter
    freq = {}

    # Loop through each string in the list and increment the frequency of each letter it contains
    for s in lst:
        for c in s.lower():
            if c in freq:
                freq[c] += 1
            else:
                freq[c] = 1

    # Check if there are at most 257 pairs of anagrams in the list
    return len(freq) <= 257
```
This function takes a single argument, `lst`, which is a list of strings. The function first initializes a dictionary called `freq` to store the frequency of each letter in all the strings in the list. Then, it loops through each string in the list and increments the frequency of each letter it contains. Finally, the function checks if there are at most 257 pairs of anagrams in the list, which is done by checking if the length of `freq` is less than or equal to 257. If this condition is true, then the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
