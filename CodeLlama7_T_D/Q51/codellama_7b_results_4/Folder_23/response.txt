This code will work for the specifications you provided. Here's a brief explanation of what each line does:
* `def if_contains_anagrams(my_list):`: This line defines a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes one argument, a list of strings.
* `anagram_count = 0`: This line initializes a variable called `anagram_count` to 0. We'll use this variable to keep track of the number of anagrams in the list.
* `for i in range(len(my_list) - 1)):`: This line starts a loop that will iterate over each pair of strings in the input list. The loop will start at index 0 and end at the second-to-last index in the list (since we don't want to compare a string with itself).
* `for j in range(i + 1, len(my_list))):`: This line starts another loop that will iterate over each pair of strings in the input list. The loop will start at the first index after the current index (i.e., i + 1), and end at the last index in the list.
* `if sorted(my_list[i]) == sorted(my_list[j])):`: This line checks if the two strings are anagrams of each other. We use the `sorted()` function to sort the strings lexicographically, and then compare them for equality using the `==` operator.
* `anagram_count += 1`: This line increments the `anagram_count` variable by 1. Since we're only counting the number of anagrams in the list, this is all we need to do.
* `return anagram_count <= 49`: This line checks if the number of anagrams in the list is less than or equal to 49. If it is, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.
