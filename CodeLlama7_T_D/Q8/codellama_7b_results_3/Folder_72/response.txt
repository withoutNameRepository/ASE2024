 ```
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    # Get the range of even integers from index 56 to index 88, both exclusive
    even_int_range = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0 and (x >= 56 and x < 88), my_list)))
    return even_int_range
```
This code uses the `filter` function to get a list of all even integers in the specified range. The lambda function used in the `filter` function checks whether the integer is even, falls between index 56 and 88 (both exclusive), and is less than 88 (since we want the range to be inclusive of index 88).
