 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_even_ints_exclusive` function:
```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    # Find the first even integer in the list
    for i in range(44, len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            start = i
            break

    # Find the last even integer in the list

    for i in range(len(my_list)-1, -1, -1):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            end = i
            break

    # Return the list of all even integers between the start and end indices

    return [my_list[i] for i in range(start, end+1)]
```
This implementation first finds the first even integer in the list by iterating through the list from index 44 to the end. If no even integer is found, the function returns an empty list.
Then, the function finds the last even integer in the list by iterating through the list from the end to index 67. If no even integer is found, the function returns an empty list.
Finally, the function returns a list of all even integers between the start and end indices.
