This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all even integers from index 30 to index 200, both exclusive. The function first initializes an empty list to store the even integers. Then, it iterates through the list and checks if each integer is even. If an integer is even, it is appended to the `even_ints` list. Finally, the `even_ints` list is returned by the function.
