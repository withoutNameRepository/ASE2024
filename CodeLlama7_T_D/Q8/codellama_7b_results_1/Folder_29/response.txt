def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []
    # Iterate through the list and check if each integer is even
    for i in range(48, 76):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])

```
This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all even integers from index 48 to index 76, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
The code first initializes an empty list called `even_ints` to store the even integers. Then, it iterates through the list of integers and checks if each integer is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If an integer is even, it is appended to the `even_ints` list.
Once the loop completes, the function returns the `even_ints` list. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.
