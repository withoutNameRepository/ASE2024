This function takes a single argument, which is a list of integers. It then creates a new empty list to store the even integers found in the specified range. The function iterates through the original list and for each integer, it checks if it is even by dividing it by 2 and checking if the remainder is 0. If the integer is even, the function adds it to the new list of even integers. Finally, the function returns the new list of even integers found in the specified range.
