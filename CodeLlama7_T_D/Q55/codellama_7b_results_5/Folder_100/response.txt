 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)) :
        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the product of the current sublist
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the elements of the current sublist
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)) :
            # Multiply the current element by the product of the previous elements
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product is equal to 48, add the current sublist to the list of sublists
            if product == 48 :
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j + 1])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
