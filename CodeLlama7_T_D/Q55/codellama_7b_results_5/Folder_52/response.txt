 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []
    # Loop through each element in the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Get the current element and its neighbors
        curr_elem = circular_list[i]
        prev_elem = circular_list[(i - 1) % len(circular_list)]
        next_elem = circular_list[(i + 1) % len(circular_list)]
        # Calculate the product of the current element and its neighbors
        curr_prod = curr_elem * prev_elem * next_elem
        # Check if the product is equal to the given value
        if curr_prod == 37:
            # Add the sublist to the list of sublists
            sublists.append([curr_elem, prev_elem, next_elem])
    return sublists
```
This code uses a loop to iterate through each element in the circular list. For each element, it gets its neighbors and calculates their product. If the product is equal to 37, the function adds the corresponding sublist to the list of sublists to be returned. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
