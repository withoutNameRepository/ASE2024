 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []
    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Get the current element and its neighbors
        curr_element = circular_list[i]
        prev_element = circular_list[(i - 1) % len(circular_list)]
        next_element = circular_list[(i + 1) % len(circular_list)]
        # Check if the product of the current element and its neighbors is equal to -5
        if curr_element * prev_element * next_element == -5:
            # If so, add the sublist to the list of sublists
            sublists.append([curr_element, prev_element, next_element])
    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
Here is an example usage of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
# Create a circular list of integers
circular_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Find all sublists in the circular list whose product equals -5
sublists = lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list)
# Print the list of sublists
#print(sublists)
```
This code will output the following list: `[[1, 2, 3]]`.
