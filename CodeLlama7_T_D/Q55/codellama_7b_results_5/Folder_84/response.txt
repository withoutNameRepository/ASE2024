 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the given list
    for i in range(len(lst)):

        # Compute the product of the elements from the current element up to the end of the list
        prod_up = 1
        for j in range(i, len(lst)):
            prod_up *= lst[j]

        # Compute the product of the elements from the beginning of the list up to the current element
        prod_down = 1
        for j in range(len(lst) - 1, -1, -1):
            if j >= i:
                break

            prod_down *= lst[j]

        # If the product of the elements from the current element up to the end of the list equals -906, add the sublist to the returned list
        if prod_up == -906:
            sublists.append(lst[i:])

        # If the product of the elements from the beginning of the list up to the current element equals -906, add the sublist to the returned list
        if prod_down == -906:
            sublists.append(lst[:i + 1])

    # Return the list of sublists that satisfy the condition
    return sublists
```
This implementation first initializes an empty list `sublists` to store the sublists that have a product equal to -906. Then, it iterates over the elements of the given list using a nested loop. For each element `i` in the list, it computes the product of all elements from the current element up to the end of the list using the formula `prod_up = 1 * lst[i] * lst[i + 1] * ... * lst[len(lst) - 1]`. If this product is equal to -906, it adds the sublist `[lst[i], lst[i + 1], ..., lst[len(lst) - 1]]` to `sublists`.
Next, it computes the product of all elements from the beginning of the list up to the current element using the formula `prod_down = 1 * lst[0] * lst[1] * ... * lst[i]`. If this product is equal to -906, it adds the sublist `[lst[0], lst[1], ..., lst[i]]` to `sublists`.
Finally, it returns the list of sublists that have a product equal to -906.
