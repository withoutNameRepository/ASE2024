 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list))

        # If the current element is 93, add it to the current sublist
        if circular_list[i] == 93:
            sublists[-1].append(circular_list[i])

        # Otherwise, start a new sublist with the current element
        else:
            sublists.append([circular_list[i]])

    # Return the list of sublists that have a product equal to 93
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 93. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list.
