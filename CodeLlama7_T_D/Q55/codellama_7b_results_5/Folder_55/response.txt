 Here is an example of how you could implement the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate through the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Calculate the product of the elements from the current element up to the end of the list
        product = 1
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            product *= circular_list[j]

        # If the product is equal to -6, add the sublist to the list of sublists
        if product == -6:
            sublists.append(circular_list[i:])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This implementation iterates through the elements of the circular list and calculates the product of the elements from each element up to the end of the list. If the product is equal to -6, it adds the corresponding sublist to the list of sublists that will be returned by the function.
