 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):
    # initialize an empty list for the result
    result = []

    # loop over the elements of the given list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # compute the product of the current element and all previous elements
        prod = 1
        for j in range(i):
            prod *= lst[j]

        # add the current sublist to the result if its product equals -1
        if prod == -1:
            result.append(lst[i-len(result):i])

    # return the list of sublists with their product equal to -1
    return result
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the given list, and computes the product of each element with all previous elements. If the product equals -1, the current sublist is added to the result list. The resulting list contains all contiguous sublists from the original list such that their product equals -1, in any order.
