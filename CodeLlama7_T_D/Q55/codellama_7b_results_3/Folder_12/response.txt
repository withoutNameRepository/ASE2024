 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []
    # Loop through the elements of the given list
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its subsequent elements
        product = 1

        # Loop through the remaining elements of the given list starting from the current index
        for j in range(i + 1, len(my_list)):
            # Update the product variable with the product of the current element and its subsequent elements
            product *= my_list[j]

        # If the product is equal to -18, add the sublist to the list of sublists
        if product == -18:
            sublists.append(my_list[i:j])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
