 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the circular list and compute the product of each contiguous sequence of integers
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        product = 1

        # Compute the product of the current sequence of integers
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product equals 48, add the current sequence to the list of sublists
            if product == 48:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j+1])

    # Return the list of sublists that have a product equal to 48
    return sublists
```
