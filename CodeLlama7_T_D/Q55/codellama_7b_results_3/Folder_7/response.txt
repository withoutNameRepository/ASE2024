 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
	# Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
	sublists = []

	# Iterate over the elements of the circular list
	for i in range(len(circular_list)):

		# Initialize a variable to store the current product
		product = 1

		# Initialize a variable to store the current sublist
		sublist = []

		# Iterate over the elements of the circular list starting from the current element
		for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):

			# Multiply the current product by the current element
			product *= circular_list[j]

			# Add the current element to the current sublist
			sublist.append(circular_list[j])

			# If the product is equal to 537, add the current sublist to the list of sublists and break out of the inner loop
			if product == 537:
				sublists.append(sublist)
				break

	# Return the list of sublists
	return sublists
```
This implementation iterates over the elements of the given circular list and calculates the product of the current element and the previous elements in the circular list. If the product is equal to 537, it adds the current sublist to a list of sublists and breaks out of the inner loop. The function then returns the list of sublists.
