 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its predecessor
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the elements of the circular list, starting from the current element
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            # Update the product by multiplying it with the current element
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product is equal to -7, add the sublist containing the elements from the current element to its predecessor to the list of sublists
            if product == -7:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i-1:j+1])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
