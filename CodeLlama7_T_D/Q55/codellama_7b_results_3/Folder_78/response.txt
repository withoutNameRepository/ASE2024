 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Get the current element and its next element
        # If the next element is not None, then it is also part of the current sublist
        current_element = circular_list[i]
        next_element = circular_list[(i + 1) % len(circular_list)] if i < len(circular_list) - 1 else None

        # If the current element is not None and its product with the next element equals 74, then add it to the sublists list
        if current_element is not None and current_element * next_element == 74:
            sublists.append([current_element, next_element])

    # Return the sublists list
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input, and it returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 74. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
