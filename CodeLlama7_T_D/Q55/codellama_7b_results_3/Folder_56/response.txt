 Here's a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the circular list and find contiguous integers with a product equal to -65
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize variables to keep track of the current sublist and its product
        current_sublist = []
        current_product = 1

        # Iterate over the circular list from the current index to the end of the list
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            # Add the current element to the sublist and update the product
            current_sublist.append(circular_list[j])
            current_product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product is equal to -65, add the sublist to the list of sublists and reset the variables
            if current_product == -65:
                sublists.append(current_sublist)
                current_sublist = []
                current_product = 1

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This code first initializes an empty list to store the sublists, and then iterates over the circular list and finds contiguous integers with a product equal to -65. For each such sublist, it adds the sublist to the list of sublists and resets the variables used to keep track of the current sublist and its product. Finally, it returns the list of sublists.
Note that this code assumes that the circular list is a Python list, and that all elements in the list are integers. If the list contains other types of elements or if the list is not a Python list, then this code may need to be modified accordingly.
