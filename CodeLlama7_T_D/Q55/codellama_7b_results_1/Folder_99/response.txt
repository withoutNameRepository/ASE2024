 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate through the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and the next element
        product = 1

        # Calculate the product of the current element and the next element, if there is one
        if i + 1 < len(circular_list):
            product *= circular_list[i] * circular_list[i + 1]

        # If the product is equal to n, add the sublist to the list of sublists
        if product == n:
            sublists.append(circular_list[i:i + 2])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list as input and returns a list of sublists each containing contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals n. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list.
