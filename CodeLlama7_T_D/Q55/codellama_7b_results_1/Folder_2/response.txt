 Here is an example of how you might implement the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate through the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its previous neighbor
        product = circular_list[i] * circular_list[i - 1]

        # If the product is equal to -968, add the sublist consisting of the current element and its previous neighbor to the list of sublists
        if product == -968:
            sublists.append([circular_list[i], circular_list[i - 1]])

    # Return the list of sublists

    return sublists
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the circular list is a Python list, and it also assumes that the product of each element and its previous neighbor will always be an integer. If your circular list is not a Python list or if you want to handle floating-point numbers in your code, you may need to modify this implementation accordingly.
