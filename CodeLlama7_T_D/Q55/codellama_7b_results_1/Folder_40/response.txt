 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its successor
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the elements that come after the current element in the circular list
        for j in range(i + 1, len(circular_list)):
            # Calculate the product of the current element and its successor
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product equals -9, add the sublist containing the contiguous integers from the given list to the returned list
            if product == -9:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j + 1])

    # Return the list of sublists found in the given circular list such that their product equals -9, or an empty list if no such sublist exists
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -9. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list.
