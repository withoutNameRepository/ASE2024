 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []
    # Iterate over the elements of the input list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its successor
        prod = lst[i] * lst[(i+1) % len(lst)]
        # If the product is equal to 93, add the sublist containing the current element and its successor to the list of sublists
        if prod == 93:
            sublists.append([lst[i], lst[(i+1) % len(lst)]])
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input, and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 93. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
