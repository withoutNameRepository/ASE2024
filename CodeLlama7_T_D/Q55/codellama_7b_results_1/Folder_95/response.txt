 Here's a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements in the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Get the current element and its successor
        current_element = circular_list[i]
        next_element = circular_list[(i+1)%len(circular_list)]
        # Check if the product of the current element and its successor is equal to 28
        if current_element * next_element == 28:
            # If so, create a sublist containing the current element and its successor
            sublists.append([current_element, next_element])

    return sublists
```
