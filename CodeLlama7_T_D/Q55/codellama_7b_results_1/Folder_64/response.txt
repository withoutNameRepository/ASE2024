def lists_with_product_equal_n(my_list):
# Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
sublists = []
# Iterate over the elements of the given list
for i in range(len(my_list)):
# Check if the product of the elements from the current index to the end of the list is equal to 3
if (my_list[i] * my_list[(i+1)%len(my_list)]) == 3:

```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 3. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
