 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Loop through each element in the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Set the current element as the starting point of the sublist
        start = i

        # Initialize a product variable to store the product of elements in the sublist
        product = 1

        # Loop through each element in the circular list from the starting point to the end of the list
        for j in range(start, len(circular_list)):
            # Multiply the current element by the product variable
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product is equal to -46, add the sublist to the list of sublists
            if product == -46:
                sublists.append(circular_list[start:j+1])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This implementation first initializes an empty list `sublists` to store the sublists that have a product equal to -46. It then loops through each element in the circular list using a `for` loop, and sets the current element as the starting point of the sublist. It then multiplies each element in the sublist by a product variable `product`, which is initialized to 1 at the beginning of the loop. If the product of elements in the sublist is equal to -46, it adds the sublist to the list of sublists `sublists`. Finally, it returns the list of sublists `sublists`.
Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
circular_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sublists = lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list)
#print(sublists)
# Output: [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
In this example, the function is called with a circular list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, and it returns two sublists `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` that have a product equal to -46.
