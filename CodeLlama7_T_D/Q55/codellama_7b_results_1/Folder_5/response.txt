 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate through the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Get the current element and its successor
        element = circular_list[i]
        successor = circular_list[(i+1) % len(circular_list)]

        # Check if the product of the current element and its successor is equal to -33
        if element * successor == -33:
            # Add the current sublist to the list of sublists
            sublists.append([element, successor])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list as input and returns a list of sublists that satisfy the condition specified in the problem description. The function iterates through the circular list, gets the current element and its successor, checks if the product of these two elements is equal to -33, and adds the corresponding sublist to the list of sublists if it satisfies the condition. Finally, the function returns the list of sublists.
