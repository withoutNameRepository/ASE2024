 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Get the current element and its successor
        current_element = circular_list[i]
        next_element = circular_list[(i+1)%len(circular_list)]

        # Check if the product of the current element and its successor is equal to -5
        if current_element * next_element == -5:

            # Add the sublist containing the current element and its successor to the list of sublists
            sublists.append([current_element, next_element])
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each containing the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -5. If no such sublist exists, the function returns an empty list.
