 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # create an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # loop through the circular list

    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # initialize a variable to keep track of the product of the current sublist

        product = 1


        # loop through the elements of the current sublist

        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):

            # calculate the product of the current sublist

            product *= circular_list[j]


            # check if the product is equal to 28

            if product == 28:

                # add the current sublist to the list of sublists

                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j+1])

                # break out of the inner loop

                break


        # check if the outer loop should be broken

        if product == 28:

            # break out of the outer loop

            break


# return the list of sublists

return sublists
```
