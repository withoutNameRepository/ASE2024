 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the circular list and find contiguous integers whose product is equal to -32
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        current_product = 1
        start_index = i

        # Iterate over the remaining elements of the circular list
        for j in range(i + 1, len(circular_list) + 1):
            current_product *= circular_list[j % len(circular_list)]

            # If the product is equal to -32, add the sublist to the list of sublists
            if current_product == -32:
                sublists.append(circular_list[start_index:j])

                # Reset the product and start index for the next sublist
                current_product = 1
                start_index = j

    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input, and returns a list of sublists each of which contains contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -32. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list.
The function first initializes an empty list to store the sublists. Then it iterates over the circular list and finds contiguous integers whose product is equal to -32. For each such sublist, the function adds the sublist to the list of sublists and resets the product and start index for the next sublist.
The function returns the list of sublists at the end of its execution.
