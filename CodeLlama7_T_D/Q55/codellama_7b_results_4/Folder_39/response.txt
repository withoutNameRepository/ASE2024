 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n`:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its predecessor
        product = circular_list[i] * circular_list[i - 1]

        # If the product is equal to -46, add the current sublist to the list of sublists
        if product == -46:
            sublists.append(circular_list[i - 1: i + 1])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the circular list and computes the product of each element and its predecessor. If the product is equal to -46, it adds the current sublist to the list of sublists that will be returned by the function. The returned list contains all the sublists from the given circular list that have a product equal to -46, in any order.
