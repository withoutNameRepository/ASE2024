 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the product of the current sublist
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the elements of the current sublist
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):

            # Multiply the current element by the product of the previous elements
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product equals 76, add the current sublist to the list of sublists
            if product == 76:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j+1])

    # Return the list of sublists that have a product equal to 76
    return sublists
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the circular list and calculate the product of each contiguous sublist. If the product of any sublist is equal to 76, the function adds the sublist to the list of sublists that have a product equal to 76. Finally, the function returns the list of sublists that have a product equal to 76.
