 Here is a Python function that satisfies the given text specification:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
	# Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
	sublists = []

	# Iterate over the elements of the circular list
	for i in range(len(circular_list)):
		# Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its predecessor
		product = circular_list[i] * circular_list[i - 1]

		# If the product is equal to -33, add the sublist containing the current element and its predecessor to the list of sublists
		if product == -33:
			sublists.append([circular_list[i], circular_list[i - 1]])

# Return the list of sublists
return sublists
```
