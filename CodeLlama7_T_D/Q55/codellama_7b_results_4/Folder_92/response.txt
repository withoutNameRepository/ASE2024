 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
	# Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
	sublists = []

	# Iterate over the elements of the circular list
	for i in range(len(circular_list)):
		# Get the current element and its adjacent elements
		current_element = circular_list[i]
		previous_element = circular_list[(i - 1) % len(circular_list)]
		next_element = circular_list[(i + 1) % len(circular_list)]

		# Calculate the product of the current element and its adjacent elements
		product = current_element * previous_element * next_element

		# If the product is equal to 5, add the sublist containing the current element and its adjacent elements to the list of sublists
		if product == 5:
			sublists.append([current_element, previous_element, next_element])

	# Return the list of sublists
	return sublists
```
This implementation first initializes an empty list to store the sublists. It then iterates over the elements of the circular list and for each element calculates the product of the current element and its adjacent elements. If the product is equal to 5, it adds the sublist containing the current element and its adjacent elements to the list of sublists. Finally, it returns the list of sublists.
