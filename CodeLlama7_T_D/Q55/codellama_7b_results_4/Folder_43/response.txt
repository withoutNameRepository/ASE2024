 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):
    # create an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # loop through the elements of the given list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its neighbors
        product = 1

        # loop through the neighbors of the current element
        for j in range(i - 1, i + 2):
            # if the neighbor is out of bounds or not an integer, skip it
            if j < 0 or j >= len(lst) or not isinstance(lst[j], int)):
                continue

            # multiply the product by the current element and its neighbors
            product *= lst[j]

        # if the product is equal to -26, add the sublist to the list of sublists
        if product == -26:
            sublists.append(lst[i - 1 : i + 2])

    # return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
