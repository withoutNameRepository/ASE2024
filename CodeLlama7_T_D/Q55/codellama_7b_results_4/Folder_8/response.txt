 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the current product
        current_product = 1

        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the size of the current sublist
        current_sublist_size = 0

        # Iterate over the elements of the circular list starting from the current element
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):

            # Calculate the product of the current element and all previous elements in the sublist
            current_product *= circular_list[j]

            # Increment the size of the current sublist by 1
            current_sublist_size += 1

            # Check if the product is equal to -41, if yes then add the sublist to the list of sublists
            if current_product == -41:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j + 1])
                break

        # If the size of the current sublist is greater than or equal to the size of the given list, then break the loop
        if current_sublist_size >= len(circular_list):
            break

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over all elements in the circular list. For each element, it calculates the product of the element and all previous elements in the sublist, and checks if the product is equal to -41. If yes, then it adds the sublist to the list of sublists.
The time complexity of this implementation is O(n^2), where n is the length of the circular list. The space complexity is O(n) because we need to store all elements in the circular list and their corresponding products.
Note that this solution assumes that the given circular list consists only of integers. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list.
