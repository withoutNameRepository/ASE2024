 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the current product
        current_product = 1

        # Initialize a variable to keep track of the current sublist
        current_sublist = []

        # Iterate over the elements of the circular list starting from the current element
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):

            # Update the product and the current sublist based on the current element
            current_product *= circular_list[j]
            current_sublist.append(circular_list[j])

            # Check if the product is equal to -17
            if current_product == -17:

                # Add the current sublist to the list of sublists
                sublists.append(current_sublist)

                # Break out of the inner loop since we have found a sublist that satisfies the condition
                break

        # Check if the product is equal to -17 and if so, add the current sublist to the list of sublists
        if current_product == -17:
            sublists.append(current_sublist)

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
