 Here's a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate through the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Get the current element and its index
        current_element = circular_list[i]
        current_index = i

        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current sublist
        product = 1

        # Iterate through the remaining elements of the circular list
        for j in range(i + 1, len(circular_list)):
            # Get the next element and its index
            next_element = circular_list[j]
            next_index = j

            # Update the product of the current sublist
            product *= next_element

            # Check if the product is equal to -54
            if product == -54:
                # Add the sublist to the list of sublists
                sublists.append(circular_list[current_index:next_index + 1])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
The function takes a circular list of integers as its argument and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -54. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
