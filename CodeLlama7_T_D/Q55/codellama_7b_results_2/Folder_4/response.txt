 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Loop through each element in the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Calculate the product of all elements up to and including the current element
        product = 1
        for j in range(i + 1):
            product *= circular_list[j]

        # If the product is equal to n, add the sublist containing the current element to the list of sublists
        if product == n:
            sublists.append([circular_list[i]])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This code first initializes an empty list `sublists` to store the sublists that meet the criteria. Then, it loops through each element in the given circular list and calculates the product of all elements up to and including the current element using a nested loop. If the product is equal to `n`, the function adds the sublist containing the current element to the list of sublists and continues with the next element in the circular list. Finally, the function returns the list of sublists that meet the criteria.
