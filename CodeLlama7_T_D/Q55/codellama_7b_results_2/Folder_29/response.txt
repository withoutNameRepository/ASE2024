 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list))
        # Initialize a variable to store the current product
        current_product = 1

        # Iterate over the remaining elements of the circular list
        for j in range(i + 1, len(circular_list))
            # Update the current product with the product of the current element and the next element
            current_product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the current product is equal to n, add the sublist to the list of sublists
            if current_product == n:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j + 1])

        # Reset the current product to 1 for the next iteration
        current_product = 1

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input, and returns a list of sublists such that each sublist contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 15. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
