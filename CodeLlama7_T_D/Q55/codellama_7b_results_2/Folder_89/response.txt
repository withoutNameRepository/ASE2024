 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Get the current element and its successor
        current_element = circular_list[i]
        next_element = circular_list[(i+1)%len(circular_list)]

        # Check if the product of the current element and its successor is equal to 57
        if current_element * next_element == 57:
            # If so, add the sublist consisting of the current element and its successor to the list of sublists
            sublists.append([current_element, next_element])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input, and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 57. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list.
