 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate through the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current sublist
        product = 1

        # Add the current element to the current sublist
        sublist.append(circular_list[i])

        # Iterate through the remaining elements of the circular list
        for j in range(i+1, len(circular_list)):
            # Calculate the product of the current sublist and the next element
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product equals -10, add the sublist to the list of sublists and reset the variables
            if product == -10:
                sublists.append(sublist)
                product = 1
                sublist = []

        # Add the last element to the current sublist
        sublist.append(circular_list[i])

    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -10. The function first initializes an empty list to store the sublists and then iterates through the elements of the circular list. For each element, the function adds the current element to the current sublist and calculates the product of the current sublist and the next element. If the product equals -10, the function adds the sublist to the list of sublists and resets the variables for the next iteration. The function returns the list of sublists after all the elements have been processed.
