 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current sublist
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the elements of the current sublist
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            # Calculate the product of the current sublist
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # Check if the product equals -7
            if product == -7:
                # Add the current sublist to the list of sublists
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j+1])

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the circular list and calculate the product of each contiguous sublist. If the product equals -7, the current sublist is added to the list of sublists returned by the function.
