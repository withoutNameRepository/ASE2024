 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its previous neighbor
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the previous neighbors of the current element
        for j in range(i-1, -1, -1):
            # Multiply the product by the current element and its previous neighbor
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product is equal to -65, add the sublist containing the current element and its previous neighbors to the list of sublists
            if product == -65:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i-1:i+1])

        # Reset the product to 1 for the next iteration
        product = 1

    # Return the list of sublists containing the contiguous integers from the given circular list such that their product equals -65
    return sublists
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the elements of the circular list and their previous neighbors. It initializes a variable `product` to store the product of the current element and its previous neighbor, and updates this value in each iteration of the inner loop. If the product is equal to -65, it adds the sublist containing the current element and its previous neighbors to the list of sublists. Finally, it returns the list of sublists containing the contiguous integers from the given circular list such that their product equals -65.
