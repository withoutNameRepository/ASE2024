 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate through the circular list and find contiguous integers that multiply to -8
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current sublist
        product = 1

        # Iterate from the current index to the end of the circular list, calculating the product of the elements along the way
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            product *= circular_list[j]

            # If the product equals -8, add the sublist to the list of sublists and reset the product variable
            if product == -8:
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j+1])
                product = 1

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
