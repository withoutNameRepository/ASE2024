 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []
    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):
        # Compute the product of the contiguous integers from the current element to the end of the list
        product = 1
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            product *= circular_list[j]
        if product == -779:
            # Add the sublist to the list of sublists
            sublists.append(circular_list[i:])
    return sublists
```
