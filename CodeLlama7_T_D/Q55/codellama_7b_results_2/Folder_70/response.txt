 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Get the current element and its index in the list
        element = circular_list[i]
        index = i

        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the elements in the sublist
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the elements of the sublist
        for j in range(index, len(circular_list)):

            # Get the current element and its index in the list
            current_element = circular_list[j]
            current_index = j

            # If the product of the elements in the sublist is equal to 32, add the sublist to the list of sublists
            if product == 32:
                sublists.append(circular_list[index:current_index + 1])

            # Increment the product by the current element
            product *= current_element

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
This code uses a combination of slicing and multiplication to compute the product of the elements in each sublist. If the product is equal to 32, the corresponding sublist is added to the list of sublists that will be returned by the function.
