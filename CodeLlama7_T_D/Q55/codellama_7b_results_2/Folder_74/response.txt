def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the circular list and calculate the product of contiguous integers
    for i in range(len(circular_list))):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i, len(circular_list)):
            product *= circular_list[j]
            if product == 51:
                # Add the sublist to the list of sublists
                sublists.append(circular_list[i:j+1])
                break

    return sublists

```
This code uses a double for loop to iterate over the circular list and calculate the product of contiguous integers. If the product equals 51, it adds the corresponding sublist to the list of sublists. The returned list contains all sublists that have their product equal to 51.
