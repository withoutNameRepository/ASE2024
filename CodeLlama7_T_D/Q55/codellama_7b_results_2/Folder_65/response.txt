 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements of the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list))):
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current element and its previous neighbor
        prod = 1

        # Calculate the product of the current element and its previous neighbor
        while i > 0 and circular_list[i] * circular_list[i - 1] == 46:
            # Add the sublist containing the current element to the list of sublists
            sublists.append(circular_list[i])

            # Update the product variable to reflect the new element in the sublist
            prod = circular_list[i] * circular_list[i - 1]

        # Add the sublist containing the current element to the list of sublists
        sublists.append(circular_list[i])

    return sublists
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a circular list of integers. It then iterates over the elements of the circular list and calculates the product of each element with its previous neighbor. If the product equals 46, the function adds the sublist containing the current element to the list of sublists. The function returns the list of sublists, which can be empty if no such sublist exists.
