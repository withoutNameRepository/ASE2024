 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function in Python:
```python
def lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []
    # Loop through each element in the input list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Get the current element and its index
        current_element = lst[i]
        current_index = i
        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the current sublist
        product = 1
        # Loop through each element in the input list starting from the current index
        for j in range(current_index, len(lst)):
            # Get the current element and its index
            current_element = lst[j]
            current_index = j
            # Calculate the product of the current sublist
            product *= current_element
            # Check if the product equals 4
            if product == 4:
                # Add the current sublist to the list of sublists
                sublists.append(lst[i:j+1])
    return sublists
```
This code uses a similar approach as the previous solution, but with some minor differences in how the sublists are generated and checked for equality to 4. The main difference is that this code checks for equality to 4 in the `product` variable instead of directly comparing the product to 4 in the loop. This allows the code to handle cases where the input list contains duplicates of a sublist with a product equal to 4, and to return all such sublists in the returned list.
