Explanation:

The function `lists_with_product_equal_n` takes a circular list of integers as input and returns a list of sublists each containing the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals -81. The function iterates over the elements of the circular list starting at index `i = 0` and checks if the product of all the elements in the sublist is equal to -81. If it is, then the sublist is added to the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
The function also handles duplicates of such a sublist by adding them all to the returned list.
Note that the function assumes that the circular list is non-empty and that there are no duplicate elements in the list.
