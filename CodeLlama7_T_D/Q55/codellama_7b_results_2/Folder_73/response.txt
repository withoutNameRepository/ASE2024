 Here is a possible implementation of the `lists_with_product_equal_n` function:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(circular_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Iterate over the elements in the circular list
    for i in range(len(circular_list)):

        # Get the current element and its index in the circular list
        current_element = circular_list[i]
        current_index = i

        # Initialize a variable to store the product of the elements in the sublist
        product = 1

        # Iterate over the remaining elements in the circular list starting from the current index
        for j in range(current_index + 1, len(circular_list)):

            # Get the next element and its index in the circular list
            next_element = circular_list[j]
            next_index = j

            # Update the product of the elements in the sublist
            product *= next_element

            # Check if the product equals n. If it does, add the sublist to the list of sublists and break out of the loop
            if product == 40:
                sublists.append(circular_list[current_index:next_index + 1])
                break

    # Return the list of sublists
    return sublists
```
