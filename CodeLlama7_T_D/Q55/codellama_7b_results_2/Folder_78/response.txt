 Here is a possible implementation of the function `lists_with_product_equal_n` in Python:
```
def lists_with_product_equal_n(lst):
    # Check if the list is empty
    if not lst:
        return []

    # Create an empty list to store the sublists
    sublists = []

    # Initialize variables for keeping track of the current product and its length
    curr_product = 1
    curr_length = 0

    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(len(lst)):

        # Update the current product and its length
        curr_product *= lst[i]
        curr_length += 1

        # Check if the current product is equal to n
        if curr_product == n:
            sublists.append(lst[i-curr_length+1:i+1])

    return sublists
```
This function takes a circular list of integers as input, and returns a list of sublists each of which contains the contiguous integers from the given list such that their product equals 74. Each sublist in the returned list can be of any size as long as it is smaller than or equal to the size of the given list. If no such sublist exists, the function should return an empty list. If there are duplicates of such a sublist, they should all be contained in the returned list. The order of sublists in the returned list does not matter.
