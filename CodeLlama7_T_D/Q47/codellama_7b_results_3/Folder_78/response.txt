 ```
def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):
    # Define the substring range for palindrome search
    start = 15
    end = 72

    # Initialize an empty set to store palindromes
    palindromes = set()

    # Iterate over the characters in the specified substring range
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        # Check if the character at index i is a palindrome
        if string[i:i+1] == string[i:i+1][::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(string[i:i+1])

    # Return the set of palindromes that meet the specified requirements
    return palindromes
```
This code uses a similar approach as before, but with the addition of the `start` and `end` variables to specify the range of indices for the substring search. The `range()` function is used to generate a sequence of integers from `start` to `end`, which are then used as the indices for accessing the characters in the string.
In this version of the code, we also use a set to store the palindromes, rather than a list. This allows us to more easily check if a given palindrome has already been found, and avoids duplicates in the final result.
