 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function in Python:
```python
def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):
    # Convert the input string to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    string = string.lower()
    # Define a list of all palindrome lengths between 42 and 77, inclusive
    palindrome_lengths = [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each palindrome length in the list of lengths
    for length in palindrome_lengths:
        # Define a substring of the input string starting at index 12 and ending at index 92, inclusive
        substr = string[12:92]
        # Iterate over each character in the substring
        for i in range(len(substr)):
            # Check if the current character is a palindrome of length `length` by checking its mirror image
            if substr[i] == substr[len(substr) - 1 - i]:
                # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
                palindromes.add(substr[i])
    return palindromes
```
This code first converts the input string to lowercase for case-insensitive matching. Then, it defines a list of all palindrome lengths between 42 and 77 (both inclusive). Next, it initializes an empty set `palindromes` to store the palindromes that are found in the specified index range. Finally, it iterates over each palindrome length in the list of lengths, and for each length, it defines a substring of the input string starting at index 12 and ending at index 92 (inclusive). Then, it iterates over each character in the substring, and for each character, it checks if the current character is a palindrome of length `length` by checking its mirror image. Finally, if the current character is a palindrome, it adds the character to the set of palindromes.
