 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function:
```
def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop over the characters in the substring from index 127 to index 288, both inclusive
    for i in range(127, 289):
        # Check if the character at index i is a letter (i.e., not a whitespace or punctuation character)
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Loop over the characters in the substring from index i to index 288, both inclusive
            for j in range(i, 289):
                # Check if the character at index j is a letter (i.e., not a whitespace or punctuation character)
                if string[j].isalpha():
                    # Check if the substring from index i to index j forms a palindrome
                    if string[i:j+1] == string[i:j+1][::-1]:
                        # Add the substring from index i to index j to the set of palindromes
                        palindromes.add(string[i:j+1])
    return palindromes
```
This function first initializes an empty set `palindromes` to store the palindromes that are found. It then loops over the characters in the substring from index 127 to index 288, both inclusive (i.e., the range of indices that correspond to the letters "t" through "z" in a standard QWERTY keyboard layout). For each character at an index `i` within this range, the function checks if the character at index `i` is a letter (i.e., not a whitespace or punctuation character) using the `isalpha()` method of the string class. If the character at index `i` is a letter, the function then loops over the characters in the substring from index `i` to index 288, both inclusive (i.e., the range of indices that correspond to the letters "t" through "z" in a standard QWERTY keyboard layout). For each character at an index `j` within this range, the function checks if the character at index `j` is a letter (i.e., not a whitespace or punctuation character) using the `isalpha()` method of the string class. If the character at index `j` is a letter, the function then checks if the substring from index `i` to index `j` forms a palindrome (i.e., the same string backwards). The function uses the `==` operator to compare the substring from index `i` to index `j` with the reverse of the substring from index `i` to index `j`. If the substring from index `i` to index `j` is a palindrome, the function adds the substring to the set of palindromes. The function returns the set of palindromes that were found.
