 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function:
```python
def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):
    # Define the range of lengths that should be considered
    length_range = range(10, 21)
    # Define the range of indices that should be considered
    index_range = range(10, 76)
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each length in the length range
    for length in length_range:
        # Get the substring that corresponds to the current length
        substring = string[index_range[0]:index_range[-1]]
        # Iterate over each index in the substring
        for i in range(len(substring)):
            # Get the slice of the substring that starts at the current index and has a length equal to the current length
            slice_ = substring[i:i+length]
            # Check if the slice is a palindrome
            if slice_ == slice_[::-1]:
                # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
                palindromes.add(slice_)
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This code first defines two ranges: one for the lengths that should be considered, and another for the indices in the substring that should be considered. It then initializes an empty set to store the palindromes.
Next, the code iterates over each length in the length range, and for each length, it gets the substring that corresponds to that length. It then iterates over each index in the substring, and for each index, it gets the slice of the substring that starts at the current index and has a length equal to the current length.
Finally, the code checks if the slice is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If it is, it adds it to the set of palindromes. The code then returns the set of palindromes.
