This function takes a single argument, `string`, which represents the input string that may contain any character. The function returns a set of all palindromes with the desired lengths within the specified index range.
The function first finds the indices of the substring to consider by using the start and end indices provided in the text specification. It then creates an empty set, `palindromes`, to store the palindromes found within the specified index range.
Next, the function iterates through each character in the input string within the specified index range, using a nested loop to check for palindromes of the desired lengths. If a palindrome is found, it is added to the set of palindromes, `palindromes`.
Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes found within the specified index range and with the desired lengths.
