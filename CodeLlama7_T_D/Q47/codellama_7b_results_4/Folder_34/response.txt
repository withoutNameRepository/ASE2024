def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):
    # Initialize the set of palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each substring between indices 200 and 300
    for i in range(200, 301):
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome
        if string[i:i+1] == string[i:i+1][::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(string[i:i+1])

```
This code first defines a function `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` that takes one argument, a string. The function then initializes an empty set to store the palindromes.
The function then loops through each substring between indices 200 and 300 in the input string. For each substring, the function checks if it is a palindrome by comparing its original form with its reverse form. If the substring is a palindrome, the function adds it to the set of palindromes.
Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes found in the input string between indices 200 and 300.
