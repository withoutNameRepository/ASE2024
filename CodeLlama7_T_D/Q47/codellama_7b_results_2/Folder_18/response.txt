 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_of_specific_lengths` function:
```python
def palindromes_of_specific_lengths(string):
    # Lowercase the string for case-insensitive search
    string = string.lower()
    # Define the index range and palindrome lengths to consider
    index_range = slice(11, 83)
    min_length = 13
    max_length = 66
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over the characters in the specified index range
    for i in range(*index_range.indices(len(string)))):
        # Check if the current character is a letter (a-z or A-Z)
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Define a variable to store the length of the palindrome starting at index i
            length = 0
            # Iterate over the characters in the range [i, len(string))
            for j in range(i, len(string)):
                # Check if the current character is a letter (a-z or A-Z) and is not equal to the previous character
                if string[j].isalpha() and string[j] != string[j-1]:
                    # Increment the length of the palindrome by 1
                    length += 1
            # Check if the length of the palindrome is within the specified range
            if min_length <= length <= max_length:
                # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
                palindromes.add(string[i:i+length])
    return palindromes
```
This code uses a combination of slicing and string manipulation to find the palindromes in the specified index range that meet the specified length requirements. It first lowercases the input string for case-insensitive search, then defines the index range and palindrome lengths to consider. Next, it iterates over the characters in the specified index range and checks if each character is a letter (a-z or A-Z). If a character is a letter, the code defines a variable to store the length of the palindrome starting at that index, then iterates over the remaining characters in the range [i, len(string)) to find the longest palindrome starting at each index. Finally, it checks if the length of the palindrome is within the specified range and adds it to the set of palindromes if so.
