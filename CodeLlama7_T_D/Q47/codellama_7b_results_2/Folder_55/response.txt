This function takes one argument, a string, and returns the set of all palindromes with lengths between 10 and 20 (both inclusive) that occur in the substring from index 10 to index 75 (both inclusive). The function considers only English letters. If no such palindrome with the length specified occurs in the specified index range, the function returns an empty set.
