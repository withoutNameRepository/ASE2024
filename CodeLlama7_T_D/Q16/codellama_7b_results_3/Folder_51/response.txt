 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list of integers, starting from index 1 and ending at index 8 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(1, 9):
        # If the current element is even, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum of all even integers from index 1 to index 8 (both inclusive)
    return sum
```
This code first initializes the `sum` variable to 0. It then iterates over the list of integers, starting from index 1 and ending at index 8 (both inclusive). For each element in the range, if it is even, the current element is added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the `sum` variable is returned as the result of the function.
