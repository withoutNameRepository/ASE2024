 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    total = 0

    # Iterate through the list, starting from index 0
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        # If the current element is even, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]

    # Return the sum
    return total
```
Here's a breakdown of how the function works:
1. The function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers.
2. The function initializes a variable called `total` to store the sum of all even integers in the specified range. Since we know that there are no even integers outside of this range, we can start with the assumption that `total` is equal to 0.
3. The function then iterates through the list, starting from index 0. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is even by using the modulo operator (%). If the current element is even, the function adds it to the sum stored in `total`.
4. Once the function has finished iterating through the entire list, it returns the final value of `total` as the result of the function.
For example, if we call the function with a list of integers like this:
# (modified) ```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list)
# (modified) ```
The function will iterate through the entire list and add up all the even integers (2, 4), resulting in a total of 6. The function will then return this value as the result of the function.
