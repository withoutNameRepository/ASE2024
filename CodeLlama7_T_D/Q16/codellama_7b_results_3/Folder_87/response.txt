 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list from index 36 to index 46, both inclusive
    for i in range(36, 47):
        # If the current element is even, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This implementation uses a `range` object to loop through the specified range of indices in the input list. For each element in the range, it checks whether the current element is even and adds it to the sum if it is. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
