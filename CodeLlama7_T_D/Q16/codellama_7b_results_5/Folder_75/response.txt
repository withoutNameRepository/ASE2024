 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through list from index 56 to 57 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(56, 58):
        # Check if current element is even
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            # If it is, add it to sum
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return sum
    return sum
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 56 to index 57 (both inclusive). If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.
