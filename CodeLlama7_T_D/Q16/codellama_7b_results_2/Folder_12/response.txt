 Here is a Python function that meets the specification you provided:
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    total = 0
    # Iterate through the list, starting at index 14 and ending at index 64
    for i in range(14, 65):
        # If the current element is even, add it to the total
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum of all even integers from index 14 to index 64, inclusive
    return total
```
This function takes a list of integers as its only argument. It then iterates through the list, starting at index 14 and ending at index 64. For each element that is even, it adds that element to a running total. Finally, it returns the sum of all even integers from index 14 to index 64, inclusive.
