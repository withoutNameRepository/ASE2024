 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list, starting from index 75 and ending at index 94
    for i in range(75, 95):
        # Check if the current element is even
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            # If it is even, add it to the sum
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
