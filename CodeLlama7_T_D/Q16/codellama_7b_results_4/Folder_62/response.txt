 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Loop through the list, starting at index 91 and ending at index 99 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(91, 99 + 1):
        # If the current element is even, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
    return total
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate through the elements of the list that are in the specified range. It then checks each element to see if it is even, and adds its value to the sum if it is. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
