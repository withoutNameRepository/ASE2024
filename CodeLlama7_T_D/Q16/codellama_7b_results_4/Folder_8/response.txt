 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the even integers in the specified range
    for i in range(23, len(my_list), 2):
        # Add the current even integer to the sum
        sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 23 to index 23, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.
