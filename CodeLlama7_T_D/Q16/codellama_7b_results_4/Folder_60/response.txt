 ```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through list from index 75 to 85, both inclusive
    for i in range(75, 86):
        # If current element is even, add it to sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    return sum
```
This code defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 75 to index 85, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
