 Here's a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Loop through the list from index 40 to index 80, both inclusive
    for i in range(40, 81):
        # If the current element is even, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
    return total
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all even integers from index 40 to index 80, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
