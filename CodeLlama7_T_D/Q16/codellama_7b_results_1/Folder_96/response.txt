 Here's a possible implementation of the `sum_even_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Iterate through the list, starting from index 50 and ending at index 200 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(50, 201):
        # If the current element is even, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
    return total
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list has at least 50 elements. If the list has fewer than 50 elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`. You can handle this error by adding a check before the loop to ensure that the list is long enough. For example:
```python
if len(my_list) < 50:
    raise IndexError("List too short")
```
