 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_neg_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the negative integers
    neg_ints = []

    # Loop through the list, starting from index 75 and ending at index 94 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(75, 95):
        # Check if the current element is a negative integer
        if my_list[i] < 0:
            # If it is, add it to the list of negative integers
            neg_ints.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the list of all negative integers from index 75 to index 94 (both inclusive)
    return neg_ints
```
This function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. It then loops through the elements of `my_list` starting from index 75 and ending at index 94 (both inclusive). For each element it checks if it is a negative integer, if it is, it adds it to a new list called `neg_ints`. Finally, it returns the `neg_ints` list.
