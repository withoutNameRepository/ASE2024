 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    # Insert 76 at index 44
    my_list.insert(44, 76)
    return my_list

# Test the function with a sample list
sample_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
#print(insert_at_index(sample_list))
```
This code will insert the value 76 at index 44 in the given list and return a new list that is identical except for this insertion. The `insert()` method of lists takes two arguments: the index at which to insert the element, and the element to be inserted. In this case, we are inserting the value 76 at index 44.
