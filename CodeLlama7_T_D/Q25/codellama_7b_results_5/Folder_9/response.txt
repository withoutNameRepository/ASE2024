 Here is a Python function that meets the specification you provided:
```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    # Create a new list with an extra element at index 66
    new_list = my_list[:66] + [45] + my_list[66:]
    return new_list
```
This function takes in a list as its argument, and it returns a new list that is identical to the original except for the fact that 45 has been inserted at index 66.
