 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    return my_list[:74] + [517.71] + my_list[74:]
```
Explanation:

The function `insert_at_index` takes a list as its argument, and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that 517.71 has been inserted at index 74.
To achieve this, the function uses slicing to extract the elements of the original list up to index 74, then adds the element 517.71 to the list using the `+` operator, and finally appends the remaining elements of the original list starting from index 74 using the `+=` operator.
Note that the function uses the same variable names as the specification, so it is clear what each part of the code is doing.
