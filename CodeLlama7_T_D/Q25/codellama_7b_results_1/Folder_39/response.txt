 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    return my_list[:97] + [47, 22] + my_list[97:]
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a list. It then returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that the sublist [47, 22] has been inserted at index 97. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.
