 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
return my_list[:31] + [88, 51] + my_list[31:]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that the sublist [88, 51] has been inserted at index 31.
To do this, we first need to slice the original list up to (but not including) the index where we want to insert the sublist. We then concatenate the sublist with the rest of the original list using the + operator. Finally, we return the new list.
