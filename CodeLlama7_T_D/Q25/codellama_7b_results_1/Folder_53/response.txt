 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    return my_list[:92] + [709.87] + my_list[92:]
```
This function takes a list as an argument, and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that 709.87 has been inserted at index 92. The returned list should have one more element than the given list, which is why we use the slice notation `[:92]` to get the first 92 elements of the list, and then add `[709.87]` to that list. Finally, we use the slice notation `my_list[92:]` to get the rest of the elements in the original list after index 92, and add them to the new list as well.
