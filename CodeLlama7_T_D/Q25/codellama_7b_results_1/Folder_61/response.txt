def insert_at_index(my_list):
return my_list[:4] + [7] + my_list[4:]
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is a list. The function returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that 7 has been inserted at index 4.
To insert an element into a list at a specific index, we can use slicing. Slicing allows us to extract a subset of elements from a list and create a new list containing those elements.
In this case, we can use slicing to extract the first four elements of `my_list`, which is done using the notation `my_list[:4]`. This creates a new list that contains the first four elements of `my_list`.
We then add the element 7 to this list using the notation `+ [7]`. This creates a new list that contains all the elements of the original list except for the element at index 4, which is now replaced with the element 7.
Finally, we use slicing again to extract the remaining elements of `my_list` after the element at index 4 has been replaced with the element 7. This is done using the notation `+ my_list[4:]`. This creates a new list that contains all the elements of the original list except for the element at index 4, which is now replaced with the element 7.
In summary, this function inserts the element 7 into a list at a specific index by using slicing to extract the relevant parts of the list and then concatenating the new element with the remaining elements of the original list.
