 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    return my_list[:598] + [385, 999] + my_list[598:]
```
Explanation:
The function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that [385, 999] has been inserted at index 598.
To achieve this, we first slice the original list up to but not including index 598 using `my_list[:598]`. We then add the two elements that we want to insert, `[385, 999]` to this slice using the concatenation operator `+`. Finally, we add the rest of the original list after index 598 using `my_list[598:]`.
The returned list should have one more element than the given list because we are inserting two elements at index 598.
