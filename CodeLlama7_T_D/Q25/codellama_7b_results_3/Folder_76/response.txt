 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    # Create a new list that is identical to the original list
    new_list = my_list[:]
    # Insert 232 at index 166 in the new list
    new_list.insert(166, 232)
    return new_list
```
This function takes a single argument, a list, and returns a list that is identical to the original list except that 232 has been inserted at index 166. The function first creates a new list that is identical to the original list using slicing. It then inserts the value 232 at index 166 in the new list using the `insert()` method. Finally, the function returns the modified new list as the output.
