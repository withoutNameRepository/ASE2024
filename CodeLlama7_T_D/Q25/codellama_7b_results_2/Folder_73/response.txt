 Here's a possible implementation of the `insert_at_index` function:
```python
def insert_at_index(my_list, index):
    # Create a new list with the same elements as my_list
    new_list = my_list[:]
    # Insert 637.22 at the specified index
    new_list.insert(index, 637.22)
    return new_list
```
This function takes a list and an integer `index` as input. It creates a new list with the same elements as the original list, and then inserts the value `637.22` at the specified index in the new list. The returned list should have one more element than the given list, which is the inserted `637.22` value.
