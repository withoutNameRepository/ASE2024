def insert_at_index(my_list):
return my_list[:90] + [80] + my_list[90:]
```
This function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that 80 has been inserted at index 90. The function uses slicing to insert the element at the desired position in the returned list.
