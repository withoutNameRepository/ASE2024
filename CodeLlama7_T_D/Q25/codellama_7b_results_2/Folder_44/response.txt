 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    return my_list[:48] + [86, 77] + my_list[48:]
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is expected to be a list. The function then returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that `[86, 77]` has been inserted at index 48. The returned list should have one more element than the given list.
