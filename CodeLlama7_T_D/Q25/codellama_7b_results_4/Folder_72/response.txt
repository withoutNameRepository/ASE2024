 ```
def insert_at_index(my_list):
    return my_list[:24] + [98, 22] + my_list[24:]
```
Explanation:

The function `insert_at_index` takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. The function returns a new list that is identical to the original list except that the sublist `[98, 22]` has been inserted at index 24.
To achieve this, the function first slices the original list up to and including the 24th element using the `[:24]` syntax. This creates a new list with all elements up to and including the 24th element from the original list.
Next, the function uses the `+` operator to concatenate the `[98, 22]` sublist onto this newly created list. The resulting list now has one more element than the original list, and it contains all the elements of the original list except for the first element of the `[98, 22]` sublist, which has been inserted at index 24.
Finally, the function uses the `+` operator again to concatenate the rest of the original list onto the newly created list, starting from the 25th element (since the first element of the `[98, 22]` sublist has already been inserted). This creates a new list that is identical to the original list except for the insertion of the `[98, 22]` sublist at index 24.
Therefore, the function `insert_at_index` returns a new list that is identical to the original list except for the insertion of the `[98, 22]` sublist at index 24.
