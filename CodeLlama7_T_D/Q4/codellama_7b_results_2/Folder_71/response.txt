 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_pos_ints_exclusive` function:
```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the positive integers
    pos_ints = []
    # Iterate over the input list, starting from index 36
    for i in range(36, len(my_list)):
        # Check if the current element is a positive integer
        if my_list[i] > 0:
            # Add the current element to the list of positive integers
            pos_ints.append(my_list[i])
    return pos_ints
```
This function takes in a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. It then iterates over the elements of `my_list` starting from index 36, and checks if each element is a positive integer. If it is, it adds that element to an empty list called `pos_ints`. Finally, it returns `pos_ints`.
Note that this function assumes that the input list has at least 36 elements, as specified in the text specification.
