This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function then finds the greatest common factor of the two numbers at indices 36 and 54 in the list.
The first step in finding the GCF is to find the smaller of the two numbers, which is done by comparing `num1` and `num2`. If `num1` is greater than `num2`, then `num2` is the smaller number. Otherwise, `num1` is the smaller number.
Once the smaller number has been found, the function uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to the smaller number, checking each value of `i` to see if it is a factor of both `num1` and `num2`. If a factor `i` is found that satisfies this condition, then `i` is the GCF.
In summary, this code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the two numbers at indices 36 and 54 in the list.
