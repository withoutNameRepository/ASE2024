This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function returns the greatest common factor of the two specified integers.
The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor of two numbers. It works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger number until the smaller number is 0. At each step, the resulting numbers are the new larger and smaller numbers, respectively. The function repeats this process until the smaller number is 0, at which point the final result is the greatest common factor of the two specified integers.
In the code, we define a list called `my_list` that contains positive integers. We then call the `gcf_two_nums` function with `my_list` as an argument. The function returns the greatest common factor of the two specified integers, which in this case is 1.
#We print the result to the console using the `print()` function.
