 ```
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return gcf(my_list[49], my_list[53])
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor (gcf) of the two numbers at indices 49 and 53. The `gcf` function is defined outside of this code snippet, but it can be assumed to be a well-defined function that returns the gcf of two non-negative integers.
