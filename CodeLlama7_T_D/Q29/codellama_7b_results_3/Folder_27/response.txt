 ```
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    # Get the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 15 and 40
    return math.gcd(my_list[15], my_list[40])
```
This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 15 and 40. The function uses the `math.gcd()` function to find the greatest common factor of two integers.
