 ```
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    # Find the greatest common factor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm
    def gcf(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    # Return the greatest common factor of the two specified indices in the list
    return gcf(my_list[372], my_list[752])
```
Note that this code assumes that the input list has at least 372 and 752 elements, and that all elements in the list are positive integers.
