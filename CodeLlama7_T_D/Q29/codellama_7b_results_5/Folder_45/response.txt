This code defines a function `gcf_two_nums` that takes a single argument, a list of positive integers. The function returns the greatest common factor of the two numbers at indices 47 and 97 in the input list.
The function first defines a variable `gcf` with an initial value of 1. This will be updated as we find factors of the two numbers at indices 47 and 97.
Next, we use a for loop to iterate over all integers between 2 and the smaller of the two numbers at indices 47 and 97. For each integer `i` in this range, we check if both numbers at indices 47 and 97 are divisible by `i`. If they are, we update the variable `gcf` to be equal to `i`, because it is a common factor of both numbers.
Finally, we return the value of the variable `gcf`, which is the greatest common factor of the two numbers at indices 47 and 97 in the input list.
