This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function then finds the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 64 and 80 using a for loop to iterate through all possible values of the greatest common factor until it finds the correct value. Finally, the function returns the greatest common factor of the two given numbers.
