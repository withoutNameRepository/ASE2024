This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of the integers at indices 60 and 64 in the input list using the Euclidean algorithm. If the two numbers have no common factors other than 1, then the GCF is 1. Otherwise, the GCF is the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
The function first calculates the minimum of the two input integers and then iteratively checks if the current number is a factor of both inputs using the modulo operator (`%`). If the current number is a factor of both inputs, the function updates the GCF variable with the current number. The function returns the final value of the GCF variable after iterating through all possible factors of the two input integers.
The function is tested with an input list of positive integers, and the output shows that the function correctly calculates the GCF of the integers at indices 60 and 64 in the input list.
