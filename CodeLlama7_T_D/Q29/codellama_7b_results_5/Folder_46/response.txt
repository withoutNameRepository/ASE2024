This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the integers at indices 36 and 54 in the input list.
To compute the GCF of two numbers, we first determine which number is smaller. We then loop through all numbers between 1 and the smaller number, checking if each number divides both of the original numbers without leaving a remainder. If we find a common factor that works for both numbers, we break out of the loop and return the factor as the GCF.
Note that this code assumes that the input list contains at least 55 elements (one more than the maximum index in the example specification).
