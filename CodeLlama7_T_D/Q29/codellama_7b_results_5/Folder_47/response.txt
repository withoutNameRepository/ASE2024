def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
return gcf(my_list[28], my_list[17])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 28 and 17. It uses the built-in `gcf` (short for "greatest common factor") function to calculate the greatest common factor of the two numbers.
