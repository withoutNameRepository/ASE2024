This code defines a function `gcf_two_nums` that takes a single argument, which is assumed to be a list of positive integers. The function then finds the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers at indices 872 and 219 in the input list using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCF is returned as the result of the function.
