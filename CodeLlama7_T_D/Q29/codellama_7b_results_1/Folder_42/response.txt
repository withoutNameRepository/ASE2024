    def gcf(a, b):
        while b != 0:

```
This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument. The function then uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers at indices 84 and 90 in the input list. The GCF is returned by the function.
