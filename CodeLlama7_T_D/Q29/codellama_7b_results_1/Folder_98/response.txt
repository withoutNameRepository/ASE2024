This function takes one argument, `my_list`, which is a list of positive integers. The function then calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers at indices 0 and 9 using the `gcf` function defined within the `gcf_two_nums` function. Finally, the GCF of the two numbers is returned as the output of the `gcf_two_nums` function.
