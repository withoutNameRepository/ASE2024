This code defines a function `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 372 and 752 in the list. The function first calculates the two numbers at indices 372 and 752 in the list, and then sets the initial value of the gcf to 1.
The function then enters an infinite loop that repeatedly checks if the greatest common factor is equal to 1. If this is not the case, the function increments the gcf by 1 and repeats the check until the gcf becomes equal to 1. Once the gcf has been determined, the function returns it.
