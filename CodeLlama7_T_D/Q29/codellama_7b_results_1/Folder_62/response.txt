This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers at indices 51 and 31 in the input list.
The function first calculates the smaller of the two numbers using an if-else statement. It then uses a for loop to iterate over the range of numbers from 2 to the smaller number, inclusive. Inside the for loop, the code checks if both `num1` and `num2` are divisible by the current number being iterated over. If they are both divisible, it sets the `gcf` variable to the current number and breaks out of the for loop.
The function returns the value of the `gcf` variable.
