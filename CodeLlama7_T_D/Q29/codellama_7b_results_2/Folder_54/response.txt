This code defines a function `gcf_two_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as an argument. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers, which are specified by their indices in the input list. In this case, the GCF is calculated between the numbers at indices 56 and 92 in the input list.
The code first defines a helper function `gcf` that takes two positive integers as arguments and returns their GCF using the Euclidean algorithm. The function repeatedly divides the larger number by the smaller number until the smaller number is zero, and then returns the final value of the larger number.
Next, the `gcf_two_nums` function calls the `gcf` helper function to calculate the GCF between two numbers specified in the input list. The function first extracts the values of the two indices from the input list and assigns them to variables `index_56` and `index_92`. Then, it passes these variables as arguments to the `gcf` function, which returns the GCF between these two numbers. Finally, the `gcf_two_nums` function returns the result of the `gcf` function.
This code satisfies the text specification by providing a function that takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 56 and 92 in the input list.
