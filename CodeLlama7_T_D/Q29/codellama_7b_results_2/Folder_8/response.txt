#This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers in the list, which are at indices 69 and 41. Finally, the function prints out the GCF.
#To test the function with a list of positive integers, we create an example list called `my_list`. Then, we pass the `my_list` to the `gcf_two_nums` function and print out the output. The output should be 3, which is the GCF of the two numbers at indices 69 and 41 in the `my_list`.
