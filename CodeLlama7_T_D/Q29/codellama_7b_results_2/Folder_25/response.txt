 Here is a possible implementation of the `gcf_two_nums` function:
```python
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    # Calculate the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers in a list
    # Check if the input list has enough elements for the GCF calculation
    if len(my_list) < 41 + 69:
        raise ValueError("The input list must have at least 41 + 69 = 100 elements")
    # Calculate the GCF of the two numbers at indices 41 and 69
    gcf = _gcf(my_list[41], my_list[69])
    return gcf
```
This function takes a list as input, and returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the two numbers at indices 41 and 69 in that list. The function first checks if the input list has enough elements for the GCF calculation, and raises a `ValueError` if it does not. Then, the function calculates the GCF of the two numbers at indices 41 and 69 using an internal function called `_gcf`. This function takes two integers as input, and returns their GCF.
Note that this implementation assumes that the list passed to the `gcf_two_nums` function contains at least 100 elements, as specified in the text specification. If the list is shorter than this, the function may raise a `ValueError` or return an incorrect result.
