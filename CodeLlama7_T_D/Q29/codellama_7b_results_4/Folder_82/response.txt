This code defines a function `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 33 and 72. The function first calculates the smaller of the two numbers at these indices. Then, it uses a for loop to find the smallest number that is a multiple of both `num1` and `num2`. This number is the greatest common factor of `num1` and `num2`.
