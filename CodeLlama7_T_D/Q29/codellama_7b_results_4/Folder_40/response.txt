def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return gcf(my_list[7], my_list[9])
```
Explanation:
The function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input. It then uses the `gcf` function to find the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 7 and 9. The `gcf` function is defined elsewhere, but it can be implemented using the Euclidean algorithm or other methods.
