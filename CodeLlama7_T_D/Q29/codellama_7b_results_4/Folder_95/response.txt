This code defines a function called `gcf_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function then finds the greatest common factor of the two numbers at indices 43 and 99 in the list. This is done by finding the smaller of the two numbers, then iterating from 1 to that number and checking if it is a factor of both numbers. If a factor is found, it is returned as the greatest common factor.
