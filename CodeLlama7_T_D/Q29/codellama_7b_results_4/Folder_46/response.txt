 ```
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
return gcf(my_list[36], my_list[54])
```
Explanation:
The function takes a list of positive integers as its argument. It then uses the `gcf()` function to find the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 36 and 54 in the input list. Finally, it returns the result of the `gcf()` function.
