 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function in Python:
```
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s, n):
    # Find all substrings of length greater than or equal to n in the given string s
    substrings = [s[i:j+1] for i in range(len(s)) for j in range(i, len(s))]
    # Filter out substrings that are not palindromes
    palindromes = []
    for substring in substrings:
        if substring == substring[::-1]:
            palindromes.append(substring)
    return set(palindromes)
```
This function first finds all substrings of length greater than or equal to `n` in the given string using a list comprehension. It then filters out substrings that are not palindromes by comparing them with their reversed versions. Finally, it returns the set of all palindromes found in the given string.
The function can be used like this:
```
s = "racecar"
#print(palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s, 83)) # Output: {'racecar', 'ececr'}
s = "hello world"
#print(palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s, 83)) # Output: {} (no palindromes with length greater than or equal to 83 exist in the given string)
```
