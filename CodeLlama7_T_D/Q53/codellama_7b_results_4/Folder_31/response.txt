def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each word in the string
    for word in string.split():
        # Check if the word is a palindrome of length greater than or equal to 34
        if len(word) >= n and word == word[::-1]:

```
This function takes two arguments: a string, and an integer representing the minimum length of the palindromes to be found in the string. It returns a set containing all the palindromes of the specified length or greater that are found in the input string. The palindromes are case-insensitive.
