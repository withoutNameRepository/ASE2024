This function takes in a string and an integer `n`, and returns a set of all palindromes of length greater than or equal to `n` that exist in the given string. The palindromes are case-insensitive, meaning that both uppercase and lowercase letters are considered equivalent. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function returns an empty set.
