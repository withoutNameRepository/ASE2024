def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n=94):
# Use a set to keep track of the palindromes
palindromes = set()
# Iterate over each word in the string
for word in string.split():
# Check if the word is a palindrome by checking if it reads the same backwards as forwards

```
This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes in a string and an optional parameter `n` (defaulting to 94). The function iterates over each word in the input string using the `split()` method, and then checks if each word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed version. If the word is a palindrome, it is added to a set of palindromes, and the set is returned at the end of the function.
