 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function in Python:
```python
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s, n):
    # Convert the input string to lowercase
    s = s.lower()
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each substring of length greater than or equal to n in the input string
    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):
        # Check if the current substring is a palindrome
        if s[i:i+n] == s[i:i+n][::-1]:
            # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(s[i:i+n])
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This function takes two arguments: `s`, which is the input string, and `n`, which is the minimum length of the palindromes to be found. It returns a set of all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 38 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
