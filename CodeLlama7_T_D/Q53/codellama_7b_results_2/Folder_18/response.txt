 Here is a Python function that satisfies the given text specification:
```python
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Check if the current character is a letter (a-z or A-Z)
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Get the length of the current palindrome
            palindrome_length = 1
            # Loop through each character in the remaining part of the string
            for j in range(i + 1, len(string)):
                # Check if the current character is a letter (a-z or A-Z)
                if string[j].isalpha():
                    # Get the length of the current palindrome
                    palindrome_length += 1
                    # Check if the current palindrome has a length greater than or equal to n
                    if palindrome_length >= n:
                        # Add the current palindrome to the set of palindromes
                        palindromes.add(string[i:j])
            # Check if any palindromes were found with a length greater than or equal to n
            if len(palindromes) > 0:
                # Return the set of palindromes
                return palindromes
    # If no palindromes were found, return an empty set
    return set()
