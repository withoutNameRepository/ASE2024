This code defines a function `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes two arguments: `string`, which is the input string, and `n`, which is the minimum length of the palindromes to be returned.
The function first creates an empty set to store the palindromes. It then loops through each character in the input string, starting from the first character. For each character, it extracts a substring starting from that character and ending at the end of the input string.
Next, it checks if the extracted substring is a palindrome. To do this, it simply compares the substring to its reverse. If they are equal, then the extracted substring is a palindrome.
If the extracted substring is a palindrome, the function adds it to the set of palindromes.
Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes with length greater than or equal to `n`.
