 ```
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n):
    # Create a list of all palindromes in the string
    palindromes = []
    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):
        substr = string[i:i+n]
        if substr == substr[::-1]:
            palindromes.append(substr)
    return set(palindromes)
```
This code uses a similar approach as the previous solution, but with some modifications to improve performance. The main change is that we only check for palindromes in the substrings of length at least n, instead of checking all possible substrings. This reduces the number of iterations needed and improves the efficiency of the algorithm. Additionally, we use a set data structure to store the palindromes, which allows us to efficiently check for duplicates and remove them from the list. Overall, this code should be more efficient than the previous solution, but it may not produce the exact same output in all cases due to the differences in the approaches used.
