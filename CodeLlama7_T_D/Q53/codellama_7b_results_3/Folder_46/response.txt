 Here is the Python code for the specified task:
```
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(input_string, n):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each word in the input string
    for word in input_string.split():
        # Check if the word is a palindrome of length greater than or equal to n
        if len(word) >= n and word == word[::-1]:
            # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(word)
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This code defines a function called `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` that takes two arguments: a string, and an integer representing the minimum length of the palindromes to be found. The function returns a set containing all palindromes of the length greater than or equal to 86 that exist in the given string. Each palindrome should only consist of English letters. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function should return an empty set. The function should find the palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
