This function takes a single argument `string`, which is the input string, and another argument `n`, which is the minimum length of the palindromes to find. The function returns a set containing all palindromes of length greater than or equal to `n` that exist in the given string. If no such palindromes exist in the given string, the function returns an empty set.
