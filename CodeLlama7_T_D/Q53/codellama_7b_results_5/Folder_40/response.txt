 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function:
```python
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s, n):
    # Convert the string to lowercase
    s = s.lower()
    # Create a set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each word in the string
    for word in s.split():
        # Check if the word is at least n characters long
        if len(word) < n:
            continue

        # Check if the word is a palindrome
        if word == word[::-1]:
            # Add the word to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(word)
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This function takes two arguments: `s`, which is the string that may contain palindromes, and `n`, which is the minimum length that the palindromes must have in order to be included in the set returned by the function. The function first converts the input string to lowercase using the `.lower()` method. It then creates an empty set `palindromes` to store the palindromes that are found in the input string.
The function then iterates over each word in the input string using the `.split()` method. For each word, it checks if it is at least `n` characters long using the `.lower()` method and the length of the word. If the word is at least `n` characters long, the function checks if it is a palindrome by comparing the word to its reverse using the `[::-1]` slice notation. If the word is a palindrome, the function adds it to the set of palindromes using the `.add()` method.
Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes that were found in the input string.
