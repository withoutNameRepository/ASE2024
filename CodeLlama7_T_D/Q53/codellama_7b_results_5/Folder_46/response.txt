    palindromes = []
    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):
        substring = string[i:i+n]
        if len(substring) < n:
            continue

```
This code uses the `range` function to iterate over all possible substrings of length at least `n`. For each substring, it checks whether it is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If the substring is a palindrome, it is added to the list of palindromes. Finally, the list of palindromes is returned as a set.
