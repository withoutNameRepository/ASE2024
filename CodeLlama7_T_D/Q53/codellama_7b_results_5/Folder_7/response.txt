 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function:
```
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n):
    # Split the input string into individual words
    words = string.split()

    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()

    # Iterate over each word in the input string
    for word in words:

        # Check if the word is a palindrome of length greater than or equal to 122
        if len(word) >= n and word == word[::-1]:

            # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(word)

    # Return the set of palindromes found in the input string
    return palindromes
```
