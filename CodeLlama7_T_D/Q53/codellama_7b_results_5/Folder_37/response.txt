 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function in Python:
```
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s, n):
    # Create a set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each word in the string
    for word in s.split():
        # Check if the word is at least n characters long
        if len(word) >= n:
            # Check if the word is a palindrome
            if word == word[::-1]:
                # Add the palindrome to the set
                palindromes.add(word)
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This function takes two arguments: `s`, which is the input string, and `n`, which is the minimum length of the palindromes to search for. The function first splits the input string into individual words using the `.split()` method. It then iterates over each word in the string, checks if the word is at least `n` characters long, and if it is, checks if the word is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If the word is a palindrome, it is added to a set of palindromes, which is returned at the end of the function.
