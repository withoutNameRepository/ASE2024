 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` function:
```
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list from index 1 to index 4, both inclusive
    for i in range(1, len(my_list)):
        # Check if the current element is divisible by either 4 or -6
        if my_list[i] % 4 == 0 or my_list[i] % -6 == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This code first initializes the `sum` variable to 0. Then it iterates over the specified range of indices in the input list using a `for` loop. For each element in the list, the code checks if it is divisible by either 4 or -6. If it is, the element is added to the `sum` variable. The function then returns the final value of the `sum` variable.
Note that this code assumes that the input list is non-empty and has at least five elements. If the input list is empty or has fewer than five elements, the function will return 0, which may not be the desired behavior in certain contexts.
