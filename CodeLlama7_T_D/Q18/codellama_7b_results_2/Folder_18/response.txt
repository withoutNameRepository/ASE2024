This code defines a function called `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers in the specified range (index 55 to index 66) that are divisible by either 22 or 82. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
The code first initializes three variables: `start_index`, `end_index`, and `sum`. The `start_index` variable is set to the value of the specified index (in this case, 55). The `end_index` variable is set to the value of the specified index plus one (in this case, 66).
The code then uses a for loop to iterate through the list of integers, starting from the specified index. For each element in the list, the code checks if it is divisible by either 22 or 82 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the current element is divisible by either 22 or 82, the code adds it to the sum variable.
Finally, the code returns the value of the `sum` variable.
To test the function with a sample list of integers, the code first defines a list called `my_list`. The list contains 10 elements, each element is a random integer between 1 and 100.
#The code then uses the `print()` function to print the result of calling the `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums()` function with the `my_list` as its argument. The output should be the sum of all integers in the specified range that are divisible by either 22 or 82, as shown below:
