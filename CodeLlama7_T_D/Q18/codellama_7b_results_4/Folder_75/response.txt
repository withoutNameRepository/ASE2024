 Here is a Python function that satisfies the text specification:
```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Define the divisors we want to check for
    div_92 = -92
    div_50 = -50
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum of divisible integers
    sum_divisible = 0
    # Loop through the list starting from index 20 (inclusive) and ending at index 93 (inclusive)
    for i in range(20, 94):
        # Check if the current element is divisible by either -92 or -50
        if my_list[i] % div_92 == 0 or my_list[i] % div_50 == 0:
            # If it is divisible, add it to the sum of divisible integers
            sum_divisible += my_list[i]
    return sum_divisible
```
