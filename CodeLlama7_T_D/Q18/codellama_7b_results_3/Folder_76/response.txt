 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` function:
```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sum and the current index
    sum = 0
    i = 250
    # Loop through the list, starting at index 250, and adding up all integers divisible by either 850 or 587
    while i <= 629:
        if my_list[i] % 850 == 0 or my_list[i] % 587 == 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
        i += 1

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 850 or 587 from index 250 to index 629, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
