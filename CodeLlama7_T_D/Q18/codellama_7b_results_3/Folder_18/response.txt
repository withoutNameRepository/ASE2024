 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` function in Python:
```
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sum and the indices
    total = 0
    start_idx = 55
    end_idx = 66
    # Iterate through the list from the starting index to the ending index
    for i in range(start_idx, end_idx + 1):
        # Check if the current element is divisible by either of the specified numbers
        if my_list[i] % 22 == 0 or my_list[i] % 82 == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the total sum
            total += my_list[i]
    # Return the total sum
    return total
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 22 or 82 from index 55 to index 66, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
