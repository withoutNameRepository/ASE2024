 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` function in Python:
```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sum and the current index
    total = 0
    i = 48
    # Loop through the list until the end is reached
    while i < len(my_list):
        # If the current element is divisible by either -46 or -82, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % -46 == 0 or my_list[i] % -82 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
        # Increment the current index by 1
        i += 1
    # Return the sum
    return total
```
