 Here is a possible implementation of the function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums`:
```
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sum and the index
    total = 0
    i = 50
    
    # Loop through the list until the end is reached
    while i <= 92:
        
        # If the current element is divisible by either -94 or -95, add it to the sum
        if my_list[i] % -94 == 0 or my_list[i] % -95 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
            
        # Increment the index by 1
        i += 1
    
    # Return the sum
    return total
```
