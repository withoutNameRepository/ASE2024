 Here is a function called `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` that meets the requirements specified in the text specification:
```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sum and the current index
    total = 0
    i = 56
    
    # Loop through the list from index 56 to index 88, both inclusive
    while i <= 88:
        # Check if the current element is divisible by either -59 or -79
        if my_list[i] % -59 == 0 or my_list[i] % -79 == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            total += my_list[i]
        
        # Increment the current index by 1
        i += 1
    
    # Return the sum of all integers divisible by either -59 or -79 from index 56 to index 88, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.
    return total
```
