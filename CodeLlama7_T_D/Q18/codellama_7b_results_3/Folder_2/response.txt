 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` function:
```
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the sum and the indices
    sum = 0
    start_index = 73
    end_index = 86
    # Iterate over the list from the start index to the end index, and check if each element is divisible by either 54 or 82. If it is, add it to the sum.
    for i in range(start_index, end_index + 1):
        if my_list[i] % 54 == 0 or my_list[i] % 82 == 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    # Return the sum of all integers divisible by either 54 or 82 from index 73 to index 86, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, return 0.
    return sum
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function then uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list from index 73 to index 86, and checks if each element is divisible by either 54 or 82. If it is, the function adds that element to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum of all integers divisible by either 54 or 82 from index 73 to index 86, both inclusive.
