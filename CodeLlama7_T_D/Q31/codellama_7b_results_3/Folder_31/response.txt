 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_perfect_num` function:
```
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    # Check if the list has an element at index 66
    if len(my_list) > 65 and my_list[65] != 0:
        # Check if the integer at index 66 is a perfect number
        perfect_num = my_list[66]
        for i in range(1, perfect_num):
            if perfect_num % i == 0:
                return True

    else:

        return False
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as its argument. It then checks if the list has an element at index 66 and returns `False` if it does not have such an element. If the element at index 66 is not zero, the function checks if it is a perfect number by iterating from 1 to the value of the element at index 66 and checking if it is divisible by all numbers less than or equal to it. If such an integer is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
