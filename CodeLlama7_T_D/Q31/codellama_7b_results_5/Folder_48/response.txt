In this code, we first check if the list is empty. If it is, we return false because there are no elements to analyze.
Next, we check if the element at index 247 is a perfect number. We do this by checking if its square root is an integer. If it is not, then it cannot be a perfect number.
After that, we check if the sum of the divisors of the element at index 247 is equal to the element itself. We do this by iterating through all the numbers from 2 to the square root of the element at index 247 and adding up their multiples. If the sum of these multiples is equal to the element itself, then it is a perfect number.
If none of the above conditions are met, we return false.
#Finally, we test the function with a list of positive integers using a simple print statement. We can change this to be more flexible by passing in different lists as arguments and returning different values based on the contents of the list.
