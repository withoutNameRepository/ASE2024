This code defines two functions: `if_perfect_num` and `check_perfect_number`. The first function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns true if the integer at index 790 is a perfect number, otherwise it should return false. The second function is called by the first function and takes an integer as input. It checks whether the input integer is a perfect number by summing up all its factors (excluding itself) and comparing it to the input integer. If the sum of the factors is equal to the input integer, then the number is a perfect number, otherwise it is not.
