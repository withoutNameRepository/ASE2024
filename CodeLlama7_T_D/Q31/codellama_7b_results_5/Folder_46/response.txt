Explanation:
The function takes a list of positive integers as input. It then checks if the list has less than 453 elements, and returns false if it does.
If the list has at least 453 elements, the function calculates the sum of the divisors of the number at index 453 using a loop. It then compares the calculated sum with the number at index 453, and returns true if they are equal, and false otherwise.
