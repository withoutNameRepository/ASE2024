        sum = 0

        for i in range(1, num):

```
This code defines a function `if_perfect_num` that takes a list of positive integers as input. The function first checks if the list has at least 25 elements, and returns false immediately if it does not. If the list is long enough, the function then checks if the element at index 24 is a perfect number by summing up all its proper divisors. If the sum equals the number itself, the function returns true, otherwise it returns false.
