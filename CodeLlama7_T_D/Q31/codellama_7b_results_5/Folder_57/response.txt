This code checks if the number at index 92 in the given list is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. The function `sum_divisors` calculates the sum of the proper divisors of a given number, and the function `if_perfect_num` checks if the number at index 92 in the given list is a perfect number by comparing it to the sum of its proper divisors.
