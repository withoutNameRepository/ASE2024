This code defines a function `if_perfect_num` that takes a single argument of type `list`. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the number at index 23 in the input list is a perfect number.
The function first checks if the length of the input list is less than or equal to 24. If it is, then it returns false immediately, as there are no perfect numbers with more than 24 digits.
Otherwise, the function calculates the sum of the proper divisors of the number at index 23 using a loop that iterates from 1 to the square root of the number, inclusive. It then checks if the sum of the proper divisors is equal to the number at index 23, and returns true or false accordingly.
