This code defines a function `if_perfect_num` that takes a list of positive integers as its argument. The function checks whether the integer at index 83 in the input list is a perfect number, and returns `True` if it is, or `False` otherwise.
The function first checks whether the value at index 83 is equal to 0. If it is, the function immediately returns `False`, because 0 cannot be a perfect number.
If the value at index 83 is not equal to 0, the function proceeds to calculate the sum of its proper divisors using a loop. The loop iterates over all positive integers less than or equal to the input value at index 83, and for each integer `i`, it checks whether the input value at index 83 is divisible by `i`. If it is divisible, the loop adds `i` to the sum of proper divisors.
Once the loop has completed its iterations, the function checks whether the sum of its proper divisors is equal to the input value at index 83. If it is, the function returns `True`, because this indicates that the input value at index 83 is a perfect number.
If the sum of its proper divisors is not equal to the input value at index 83, the function returns `False`, because this indicates that the input value at index 83 is not a perfect number.
