This code defines a function called `if_perfect_num` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function first checks if the list has at least 69 elements. If it does not have enough elements, the function returns false. Otherwise, the function calculates the sum of the proper divisors of the number at index 68 and compares it to the number itself. If the sum of the proper divisors is equal to the number, the function returns true. Otherwise, the function returns false.
