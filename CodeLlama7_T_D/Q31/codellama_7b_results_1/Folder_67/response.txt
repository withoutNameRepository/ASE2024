Explanation:
The function takes a list of positive integers as an argument. It then checks if the list is empty or has less than 43 elements. If this condition is not met, the function returns `False`.
Otherwise, the function gets the element at index 43 of the list and stores it in the variable `perfect_number`. The function then calculates the sum of the proper divisors of the perfect number using the formula for the sum of the proper divisors of a perfect number.
Finally, the function compares the perfect number to the sum of its proper divisors and returns `True` if they are equal, and `False` otherwise.
