 Here's the code for the function:
```python
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    # Check if the list has 9 elements
    if len(my_list) != 9:
        return False

    # Get the integer at index 8
    perfect_number = my_list[8]

    # Check if the integer is a perfect number
    if all(perfect_number % i == 0 for i in range(1, perfect_number)) and perfect_number != 0:
        return True

    else:

        return False

```
The function takes one argument, which is the list of positive integers. It checks if the list has nine elements (as it should have an integer at index 8) and then gets the integer at index 8. Then it uses a list comprehension to check if all the numbers up to and including that integer are factors of it. If the list comprehension returns true, the function returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
