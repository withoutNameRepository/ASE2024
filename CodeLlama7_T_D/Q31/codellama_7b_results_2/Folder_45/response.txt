 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_perfect_num` function in Python:
```
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    # Check if the list has at least 34 elements
    if len(my_list) < 34:
        return False

    # Find the number at index 33 of the list
    perfect_number = my_list[33]

    # Check if the number is a perfect number
    if perfect_number == (perfect_number - 1) * (2 * perfect_number - 1) / 2:
        return True

    else:

        return False
```
This function takes as input a list of positive integers, and returns `True` if the integer at index 33 of the list is a perfect number, and `False` otherwise.
