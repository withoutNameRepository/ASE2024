 Here is a Python function that meets the specification you provided:
```
def if_perfect_num(lst):
    # Check if list is empty or length < 248
    if len(lst) < 248:
        return False

    # Calculate sum of factors for number at index 247
    factor_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, int(lst[247] ** 0.5) + 1):
        if lst[247] % i == 0:
            factor_sum += i + lst[247] // i

    # Return True if sum of factors is equal to the number at index 247, otherwise return False
    return factor_sum == lst[247]
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument. It then checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to 248. If it is not, the function returns False immediately.
If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 248, the function calculates the sum of factors for the number at index 247 using a loop that iterates from 1 to the integer part of the square root of the number at index 247. For each iteration, the function checks if the current value (i) is a factor of the number at index 247 and adds the sum of factors for the current value (i) to the variable "factor_sum".
After calculating the sum of factors for the number at index 247, the function compares the value of "factor_sum" to the number at index 247 using the "===" operator. If the values are equal, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
