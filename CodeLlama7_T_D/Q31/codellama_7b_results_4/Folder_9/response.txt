This function takes a list of positive integers as its argument and returns true if the integer at index 24 is a perfect number, otherwise it returns false.
To determine if a number is a perfect number, we need to find out all its proper divisors (including 1 and itself) and then sum them up. If the sum of all proper divisors equals the number itself, it means that the number is a perfect number.
