This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns true if the integer at index 87 is a perfect number, otherwise, it should return false. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than or equal to index 87, and if so, it returns false immediately. If the length of the list is greater than index 87, the function then checks if the integer at index 87 is equal to 0. If so, it returns false as well. Otherwise, the function determines whether the integer at index 87 is a perfect number by first setting a variable called perfect_number equal to the value of the integer at index 87, and then using a for loop to iterate from 1 to perfect_number // 2 + 1 (inclusive) and checking if perfect_number % i == 0 for each iteration. If any iteration returns false, the function returns false as well. If all iterations return true, the function returns true.
