 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace('e', 'eE')
```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a single argument, a string, and returns a modified string where the character `'e'` has been replaced by the sequence `'eE'`. This allows for the insertion of the character `'E'` immediately following any occurrences of the character `'e'` in the original string.
