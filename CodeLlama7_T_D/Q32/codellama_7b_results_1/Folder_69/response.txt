if __name__ == "__main__":
#    print(insert_after_character("Hello World"))
```
This function takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string that may or may not contain the character ' '. The function returns a new string that is identical to the original except that any occurrences of ' ' have been replaced with 'P'. For example, if the input string is "Hello World", then the output string will be "HelloPWorld".
