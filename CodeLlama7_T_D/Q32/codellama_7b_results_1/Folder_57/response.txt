 Here is the Python function specified in the text specification:
```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    new_string = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if char == "s":
            new_string += char + "w"
        else:
            new_string += char

    return new_string
```
This function takes a string as input and returns a modified version of the original string where any occurrences of the character 's' are followed by the character 'w'.
