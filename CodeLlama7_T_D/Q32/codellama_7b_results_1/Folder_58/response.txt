 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("F", "FO")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument `string`, which is a string of characters. It then uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the character 'F' with the string "FO". The resulting string will contain all the original characters from the input string, except that any occurrence of 'F' will be replaced by 'FO'.
