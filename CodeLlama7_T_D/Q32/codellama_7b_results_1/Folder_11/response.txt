def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("g", "gt")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_after_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original string except that every occurrence of the character 'g' has been replaced with the sequence 'gt'. The `replace()` method is used to perform the replacement.
