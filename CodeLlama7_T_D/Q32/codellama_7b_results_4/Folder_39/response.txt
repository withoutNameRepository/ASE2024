 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("m", "mQ")
```
Explanation:

This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a modified string where the character 'Q' is inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of the character 'm'.
The function uses the built-in `str.replace()` method to search for all occurrences of the character 'm' in the input string, and replace them with themselves followed by the character 'Q'.
For example, if the input string is "hello world", the output string will be "hellomQworld".
Note: In the modified string, any occurrence of the character 'm' that appears before the first occurrence of the character 'Q' in the original string will not have any effect on the output string.
