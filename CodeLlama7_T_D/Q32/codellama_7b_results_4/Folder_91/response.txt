def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("a", "a0")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_after_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character '0' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of the character 'a'.
This is achieved by using the `.replace()` method on the input string. The `.replace()` method replaces all occurrences of the specified string (in this case, "a") with a new string (in this case, "a0").
The resulting output string will contain all the characters from the original input string, except for any occurrences of the character 'a' that have been replaced by the character 'a0'.
