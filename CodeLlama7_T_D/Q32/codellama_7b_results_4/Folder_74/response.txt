 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("T", "T ")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_after_character` takes a single argument `string`, which is a string that may or may not contain the character 'T'.
The function uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of the character 'T' in the input string with itself followed by a space. This effectively inserts a space immediately succeeding any occurrence of the character 'T' in the input string.
For example, if the input string is "Hello World!", then the output string will be "Hello World !" (note the extra space after the word "World").
