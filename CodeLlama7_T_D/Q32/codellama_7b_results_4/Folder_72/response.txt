def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("O", "Od")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_after_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original string except that the character 'd' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'O'.
The implementation of this function uses the `replace()` method of strings to insert the character 'd' after each occurrence of the character 'O'. The `replace()` method returns a new string with the replacement made, so we simply return this new string from the function.
