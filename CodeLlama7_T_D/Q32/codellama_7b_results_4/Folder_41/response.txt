 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("O", "O") + "o"
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character 'o' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'O'. The function uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of 'O' with 'O' + 'o', and then concatenates this result with 'o' to ensure that it is added only after each occurrence of 'O'.
