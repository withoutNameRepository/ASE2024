#print(insert_after_character("Hello World"))
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original except that the character 'a' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'U'. The function uses the `replace()` method to search for all occurrences of the character 'U' in the input string, and then replaces each occurrence with the corresponding substring followed by the character 'a' and the original substring.
