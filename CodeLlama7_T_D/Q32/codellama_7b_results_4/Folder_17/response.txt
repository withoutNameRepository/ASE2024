 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace('Q', 'IQ')
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character 'I' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'Q'. The function uses the `replace` method to find all occurrences of character 'Q' in the input string and replace them with character 'IQ', which inserts character 'I' immediately following each occurrence of character 'Q'.
