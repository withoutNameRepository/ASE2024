 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
return string.replace("o", "oO")
```
Explanation:
The `insert_after_character` function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original string except that every occurrence of the character 'o' has been replaced with the string "oO".
For example, if we call the function with the string "hello", it will return the string "helloO".
This solution uses the `replace` method to perform the replacement. The first argument to this method is the string that we want to replace, and the second argument is the string that we want to insert in its place. In this case, we are replacing every occurrence of the character 'o' with the string "oO".
