 Here is the Python code for the function `insert_after_character`:
```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == "Q":
            result += string[i] + "I"
        else:
            result += string[i]
    return result
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over each character in the input `string`. For each character, it checks whether it is equal to the character `'Q'` and, if so, appends the character `'I'` after it. Otherwise, it simply appends the current character without any modifications. The resulting string is then returned as the output of the function.
