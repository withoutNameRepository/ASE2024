 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
return string.replace("a", "a ")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument `string`, which is a string. The function then uses the `replace()` method to search for all occurrences of the character 'a' in the input string, and replaces each occurrence with the same character but followed by a space. The resulting string is then returned by the function.
