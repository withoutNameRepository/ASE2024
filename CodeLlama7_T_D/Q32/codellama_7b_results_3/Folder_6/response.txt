#This code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a single argument of type string. The function returns a new string that is identical to the original string except for the following: if any occurrence of character 'X' exists in the string, immediately succeeding it there should be character 'u'. The code also defines a main() function which calls the `insert_after_character` function and prints its output.
