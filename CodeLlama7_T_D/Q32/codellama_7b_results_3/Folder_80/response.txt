if __name__ == "__main__":
#    print(insert_after_character("This is a test"))
```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a single argument of type `str`. The function returns a new string where every occurrence of the space character (`" "`) has been replaced with the character `"X"` immediately succeeding it.
#Inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, we call the `insert_after_character` function with an example input string (`"This is a test"`). The output of this function call is then printed to the console.
