 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("s", "sw")
```
This function takes a single argument `string`, which is a string that may contain the character 'w'. The function then replaces any occurrences of the character 's' with the string "sw". This has the effect of inserting the character 'w' immediately succeeding any occurrence of the character 's'.
