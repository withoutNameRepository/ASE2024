 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("j", "j1")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a string as input and returns a modified string with the specified character inserted immediately after any occurrences of the target character.
In this case, the target character is 'j', and we want to insert the character '1' after it. We use the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of 'j' in the original string with 'j1'. The resulting modified string will have all occurrences of 'j' followed by '1'.
