 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
return string.replace('O', 'On')
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument `string`, which is the input string that may or may not contain the character 'O'.
The function uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of 'O' in the input string with 'On', except for the very first occurrence, which remains unchanged.
For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the output string will be "HellOn World".
