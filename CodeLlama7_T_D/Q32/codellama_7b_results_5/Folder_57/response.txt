 Here is the Python function that you requested:
```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as the original string
    new_string = ""
    # Loop through each character in the original string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # If the current character is 's', insert the character 'w' immediately after it
        if string[i] == "s":
            new_string += "sw"

        # Otherwise, just add the character to the new string as usual
        else:
            new_string += string[i]

    # Return the modified string with the inserted character
    return new_string
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
