 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("m", "mn")

#print(insert_after_character("hello"))
```
# (modified) 
This code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a single argument, which is a string. The function uses the `replace()` method to replace any occurrence of the character 'm' in the input string with the substring "mn". This is done by calling the `replace()` method on the input string and passing it the arguments "m" and "mn".
The function then returns the modified string, which now contains the inserted character.
To test this code, you can call the `insert_after_character()` function with a string as an argument, like this:

#print(insert_after_character("hello"))

This will output the string "hellomn".
