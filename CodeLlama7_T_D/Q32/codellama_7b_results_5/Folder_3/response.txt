 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace('0', 'H0')
```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character 'H' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character '0'.
The function uses the `string.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character '0' with the string "H0". The resulting string will have the desired character insertion at the correct location.
