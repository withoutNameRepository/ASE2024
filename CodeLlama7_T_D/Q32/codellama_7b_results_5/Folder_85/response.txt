 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
return string.replace("o", "o\a")
```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character 'a' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'o'.
The function uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'o' in the input string with the same sequence of characters followed by the character 'a', so that the resulting string contains the desired character at the correct position.
