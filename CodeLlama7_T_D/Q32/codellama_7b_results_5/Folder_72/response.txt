 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("O", "OD")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_after_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character 'd' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'O'.
To achieve this, the function uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'O' in the input string with the string "OD". This ensures that the output string will have the character 'd' inserted after every occurrence of character 'O'.
