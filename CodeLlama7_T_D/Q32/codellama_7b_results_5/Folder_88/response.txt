 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("a", "at")
```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that the character 't' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'a'.
To achieve this, the function uses the `replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'a' with the string "at". This ensures that any occurrence of character 'a' in the original string is replaced with the string "at", which will be inserted immediately succeeding it.
