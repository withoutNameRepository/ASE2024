 Here is a Python function that meets the specified text specification:
```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == "E":
            new_string += "E" + string[i+1]
        else:
            new_string += string[i]
    return new_string
```
This function takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string. The function then iterates through the characters of the input string, and for each occurrence of the character "E", it inserts the character immediately succeeding the "E" (which may be another "E" or any other character). The function returns the modified string that has been built by inserting the "E" characters.
