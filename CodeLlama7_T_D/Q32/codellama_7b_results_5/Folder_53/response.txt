 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace('i', 'I')
```
This function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a modified version of the string with an additional character inserted immediately after any occurrences of the target character. In this case, the target character is lowercase "i", and the additional character to be inserted is uppercase "I". The function uses the `replace()` method of strings to perform the replacement.
