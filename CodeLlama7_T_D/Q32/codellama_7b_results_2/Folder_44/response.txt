```
This code defines a function `insert_after_character` that takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string where the character `'M'` has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character `'g'`.
The function iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if it is equal to `'g'`, and if so, it adds the previously appended characters plus the new character `'M'` to the result string.
After all characters have been processed, the function returns the final result string.
In the example code at the end of the answer, we demonstrate how to call the `insert_after_character` function for several input strings.
