 Here is a possible implementation of the function `insert_after_character`:
```
def insert_after_character(s):
    return "".join([c if c != "U" else "Uq" for c in s])
```
This code uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and checks if it is equal to the character `'U'`. If it is, the function inserts the character `'q'` immediately after it. Otherwise, it returns the original character as is.
For example:
```
#print(insert_after_character("hello")) # prints "hellqo"
#print(insert_after_character("goodbye")) # prints "goodbye" (no changes)
#print(insert_after_character("UUUUUUUUU")) # prints "UqUqUqUqUqUqUq"
```
