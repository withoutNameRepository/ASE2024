 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
return string.replace("T", "T ")
```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character ' ' has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character 'T'.
The function uses the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of character 'T' in the input string with the same string followed by a space character. For example, if the input string is "Hello World", the output string will be "Hello World ".
Note that this function only works for strings that contain the character 'T'. If the input string does not contain the character 'T', the output string will be identical to the input string.
