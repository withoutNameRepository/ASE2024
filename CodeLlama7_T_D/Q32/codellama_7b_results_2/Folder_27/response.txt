 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == "N":
            result += string[i] + "j"
        else:
            result += string[i]
    return result

#print(insert_after_character("NNjj"))
```
This code uses a for loop to iterate through the characters of the input string. For each character, it checks if it is an "N", and if so, it appends the "j" character immediately after it in the output string. Otherwise, it simply copies the input character to the output string without modification.
