 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace(" ", "P ")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string of characters. The function returns a new string that is identical to the original string except for the following changes:
* Any occurrence of the space character (`' '`) in the original string is replaced by the character `'P'` followed by the same space character.
For example, if the input string is `"hello world"`, then the output string would be `"hello world"`. However, if the input string is `"hello  world"` (note the extra space before `world`), then the output string would be `"hello P world"`.
Note that this function does not modify the original string. Instead, it returns a new string that has been modified according to the rules described above.
