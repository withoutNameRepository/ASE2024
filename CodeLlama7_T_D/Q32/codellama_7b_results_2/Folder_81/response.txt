 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("A", "A_")
```
Explanation:
The function `insert_after_character` takes a single argument, a string, and returns a new string that is identical to the original string except that every occurrence of character 'A' has been replaced by the sequence of characters '_A'. The underscore character '_' serves as a placeholder for the character 'A' in the replacement pattern.
For example, if the input string is "ABC_ABC", the output string after calling the function will be "ABC_ABC". However, if the input string is "ABC_ABC", the output string after calling the function will be "ABC_A_BC".
