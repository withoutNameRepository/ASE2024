 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
return string.replace("a", "a6")
```
Explanation:
The function takes a single argument `string`, which is a string. It then uses the `replace()` method to replace any occurrences of the character 'a' in the string with the character 'a' followed by the character '6'. The resulting string is returned by the function.
