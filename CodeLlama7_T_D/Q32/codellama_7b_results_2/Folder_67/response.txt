 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace('j', '1j')
```
Explanation:
The function takes a string as input and returns a new string where the character '1' has been inserted immediately after any occurrences of the character 'j'. The replace() method is used to replace all occurrences of 'j' in the original string with '1j', resulting in the final output string.
