 ```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace("2", "2S")
```
Explanation:

The function takes a string as input and returns the same string with all occurrences of the character '2' replaced by '2S'. This is done using the `str.replace()` method, which replaces all occurrences of a given substring in a given string. In this case, the substring to be replaced is '2', and the replacement string is '2S'. The resulting string will have all occurrences of '2' followed immediately by 'S'.
