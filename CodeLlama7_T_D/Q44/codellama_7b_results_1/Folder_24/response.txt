 Here is a possible implementation of the function:
```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    # Check if the input is a list
    if not isinstance(my_list, list):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list")
    # Define the range of indices to consider
    start_index = 34
    end_index = 55
    # Initialize an empty set to store the composite numbers
    composite_numbers = set()

    for i in range(start_index, end_index + 1):
        # Check if the current number is prime or not
        if my_list[i] != 1:
            # If it's not prime, check if it's composite by dividing it by all numbers less than its square root
            for j in range(2, int(my_list[i]) ** 0.5 + 1)):
                if my_list[i] % j == 0:
                    # If the number is divisible by any number less than its square root, it's not composite
                    break
            else:
                # If we reach the end of the loop without breaking, the number is likely composite
                composite_numbers.add(my_list[i])
    return composite_numbers
```
This implementation uses the `isinstance` function to check if the input is a list. It then defines the range of indices to consider and initializes an empty set to store the composite numbers.
The code then loops through each number in the given list within the specified range, and checks if it's prime or not using the `== 1` condition. If a number is not prime, it checks if it's composite by dividing it by all numbers less than its square root. If the current number is divisible by any number less than its square root, it breaks out of the loop. If we reach the end of the loop without breaking, the number is likely composite and we add it to the `composite_numbers` set.
Finally, the function returns the `composite_numbers` set.
