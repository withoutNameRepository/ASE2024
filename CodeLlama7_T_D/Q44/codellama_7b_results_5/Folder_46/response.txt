This code will first define a function called `composite_nums_between_indices` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function should return the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 28 to index 38, both inclusive. If no composite number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty set.
The code then defines a variable called `my_list` and sets it equal to the list of positive integers from 1 to 50.
Next, the code uses a loop to iterate over each number in the `my_list`. For each number, the code checks if it is greater than 1, and if it is composite between index 28 and 38. If it is composite, the code adds it to the set called `composite_nums`.
Finally, the code returns the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 28 to index 38, both inclusive. In this case, the output should be {105, 123, 149, 151}.
