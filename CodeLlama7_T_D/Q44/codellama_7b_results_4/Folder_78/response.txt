This code uses the `is_composite` function to check if a number is composite by dividing it by all the prime factors of it. If the number is composite, it is added to the set of composite numbers that are between the indices specified in the text specification. The final result is returned as a set of all composite numbers between the indices.
The code also includes a test function `test_composite_nums_between_indices` to check if the function works correctly for a sample list of numbers.
