 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[22:88+1]
```
Explanation:
The `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as its argument. It then uses slicing to extract all elements from index 22 to index 88, both inclusive. The `+1` at the end is used to ensure that the last element is included in the slice.
The function returns the list of all extracted elements.
