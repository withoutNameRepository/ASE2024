 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[31:72+1]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as its argument, and returns the list of all elements from index 31 to index 72, both inclusive.
To achieve this, we use slicing syntax to extract the desired elements from the input list. The slice `[31:72+1]` selects all elements from index 31 (inclusive) to index 72 (exclusive), which is equivalent to selecting indices 31 through 71 (both inclusive).
Note that the `+1` at the end of the slice is necessary to ensure that the last element in the slice is included.
