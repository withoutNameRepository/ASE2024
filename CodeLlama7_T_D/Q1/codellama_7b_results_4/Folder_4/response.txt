def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[56:58]
```
Explanation:

This function takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the list of all elements from index 56 to index 57, both inclusive. To do this, we use slicing, which allows us to select a subset of elements from a larger list. In this case, we specify the range of indices we want to include in our returned list using the colon operator.
