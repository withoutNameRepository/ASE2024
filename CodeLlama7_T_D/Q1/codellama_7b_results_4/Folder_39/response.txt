 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[27:56+1]
```
Explanation:

The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of all elements from index 27 to index 55, both inclusive.
We use slicing to extract the desired range of elements from the input list. The slice notation is `[start:end]` where `start` and `end` are integers representing the starting and ending indices, respectively.
In this case, we want to extract all elements from index 27 to index 55, both inclusive. Therefore, we use the slice notation `[27:56+1]`, which will extract all elements from index 27 to index 56, both inclusive. The `+1` at the end of the slice is necessary because slicing in Python uses the first element as the start of the slice, and we want to include the element at index 56 in the slice.
The function returns the list of all elements from index 27 to index 56, both inclusive.
