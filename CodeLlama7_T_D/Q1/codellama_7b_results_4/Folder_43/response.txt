def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
return my_list[34:56]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as an argument. It returns the list of all elements from index 34 to index 56, both inclusive. This is done using slicing notation in Python, where the slice starts at index 34 and ends at index 56, with both indices included in the returned list.
