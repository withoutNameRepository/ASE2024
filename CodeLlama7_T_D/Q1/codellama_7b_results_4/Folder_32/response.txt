 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
return my_list[29:80]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as its argument, and returns a new list containing all elements from index 29 to index 79, both inclusive.

The syntax used for this function is as follows:

* `def` : This keyword is used to define a function in Python.
* `all_ints_inclusive` : This is the name of the function being defined.
* `(my_list)` : This is the argument passed to the function, which is a list of integers.
* `return` : This keyword is used to return a value from a function in Python. In this case, it returns the new list containing all elements from index 29 to index 79, both inclusive.
