def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[56:82+1]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all elements from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive. The slicing notation `start:stop:step` is used to specify the range of indices to include in the output list. In this case, we are using `start=56` and `stop=82`, which will include all elements from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive. The `+1` at the end of the slice notation is used to make sure that the last element in the output list is included, even if it is not explicitly specified in the range.
