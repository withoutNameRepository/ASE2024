def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input and returns the same list with all elements from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive.
We use slicing to extract the desired elements from the original list. We create a new list by using the slice notation `[:]` and passing it the start and end indices of the elements we want to include. In this case, we use `[:]` to include all elements from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive.
The resulting list is a copy of the original list with only the desired elements included.
