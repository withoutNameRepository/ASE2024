 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[28:39]
```
Explanation:

The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the list of all elements from index 28 to index 38, both inclusive.
To achieve this, we use slicing notation to extract the desired subset of elements from the original list. The slice `my_list[28:39]` includes all elements from index 28 up to and including index 38.
