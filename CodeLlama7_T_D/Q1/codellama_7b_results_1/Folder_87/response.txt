 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[17:78+1]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as its argument, and returns the list of all elements from index 17 to index 78, both inclusive.
To achieve this, we use slicing notation with the indices specified as `my_list[start:end+1]`. The `+1` is necessary because Python's slice indexes are exclusive by default, meaning that they do not include the element at that position in the list. By including the `+1`, we ensure that the returned list includes all elements from index 17 to index 78, both inclusive.
Note that this function will return an empty list if the input list is shorter than 17 elements or longer than 78 elements.
