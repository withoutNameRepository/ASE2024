 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[20:200+1]
```
Explanation:

The `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as its argument. It returns the slice of the input list from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive.
The syntax for slicing a list in Python is `list[start:end]`, where `start` and `end` are the starting and ending indices of the slice. The `+1` at the end of the expression indicates that we want to include the final index in the slice.
