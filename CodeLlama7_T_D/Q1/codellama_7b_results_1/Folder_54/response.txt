 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[31:72+1]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the sub-list that starts at index 31 and ends at index 72, both inclusive. The slicing syntax is used to extract the desired sub-list from the original list.
