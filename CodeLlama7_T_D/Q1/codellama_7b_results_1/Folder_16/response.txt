 Here is the function `all_ints_inclusive` that returns the list of all elements from index 31 to index 34, both inclusive:
```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[31:35]
```
The function takes one argument `my_list`, which is a list of integers. The function then uses slicing to extract the elements from index 31 to index 34, both inclusive. Finally, the function returns the list of all extracted elements.
