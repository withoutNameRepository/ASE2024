def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[60:201]
```
Explanation:

The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the list of elements from index 60 to index 200, both inclusive. To achieve this, we can use slicing in Python.
In Python, we can access a range of elements in a list by using slicing notation. The syntax for this is `my_list[start:stop]`, where `start` and `stop` are the indices that you want to include in your selection.
In our function, we set `start` to 60 (the index where we want to start our selection) and `stop` to 201 (the index where we want to end our selection). This will give us a list of all elements from index 60 to index 200, both inclusive.
Note that when using slicing notation in Python, the indices are zero-based, meaning that the first element in a list is at index 0.
