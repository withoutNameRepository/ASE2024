 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Return the list of elements from index 22 to index 63, both inclusive
    return my_list[22:64]
# Test the function with an example list
example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]
# Print the result of applying the function to the example list
#print(all_ints_inclusive(example_list))
```
