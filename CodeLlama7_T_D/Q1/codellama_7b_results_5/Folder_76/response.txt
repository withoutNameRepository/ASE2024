 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[661:924+1]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is assumed to be a list of integers.
The function uses slicing to extract the elements from index 661 to index 924 (both inclusive), and returns the resulting list.
Note that the `+1` at the end of the slice is necessary because Python slices are exclusive of the ending index.
