 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:2]
```
Explanation:

The `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. The function returns the slice of the list from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive. This means that it will return all elements from index 0 to index 1, both inclusive.
For example, if we call the function with a list like `[1, 2, 3]`, the function will return the slice of the list from index 0 to index 1, which is `[1, 2]`.
