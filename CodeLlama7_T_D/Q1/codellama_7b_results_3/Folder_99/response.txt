def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[209:556+1]
```
Explanation:

The `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of elements from index 209 to index 556, both inclusive.
The slicing operation is performed using the square bracket notation. The first index of the slice is 209, which is the index of the element we want to start the slice at. The second index of the slice is 556+1, which is the index of the element we want to end the slice at. Since we want to include the element at index 556 in the slice, we add 1 to it.
The resulting list contains all the elements from the input list that are between indexes 209 and 556, both inclusive.
