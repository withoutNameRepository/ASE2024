 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[29:93+1]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the list of all elements from index 29 to index 93, both inclusive.
We use slicing to extract the desired range of elements from the input list. The slice `my_list[29:93+1]` includes the elements at indexes 29 through 93, and the `+1` at the end ensures that the last element is also included in the slice.
We can verify that this function works correctly by calling it with a list of integers as input and checking the returned value against the expected output.
