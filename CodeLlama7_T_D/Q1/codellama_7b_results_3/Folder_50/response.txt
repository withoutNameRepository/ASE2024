 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[12:92+1]
```
Explanation:
The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a subset of the list containing all elements from index 12 to index 92, both inclusive.
We use slicing to extract the desired elements from the original list. The `+1` at the end is necessary because Python slicing uses half-open intervals, where the upper bound is not included in the slice.
