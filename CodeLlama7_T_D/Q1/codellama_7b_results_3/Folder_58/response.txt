 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[246:750+1]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the list of all elements from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive.
To do this, we use slicing to extract the desired elements from the input list. The syntax for slicing is `list[start:stop]`, where `start` is the starting index, `stop` is the ending index (exclusive), and `+1` at the end of the slice indicates that we want to include the ending index in the resulting list.
In this case, we want to extract elements from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive, so we use the following slicing syntax: `my_list[246:750+1]`.
The resulting list of elements will include all elements from the input list that have an index between 246 and 750 (both inclusive)).
