 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:7]
```
Explanation:

The `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of all elements from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive.
To achieve this, we use slicing notation in Python. The slice notation allows us to extract a subset of values from a list, using a colon (:) as the delimiter.
In this case, we want to extract all elements from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive. Therefore, we use the following slicing notation: `my_list[:7]`.
This notation tells Python to extract all elements from the start of the list (index 0) up to and including the seventh element (index 6).
By using this slicing notation, we can return a subset of values from the input list, without having to explicitly specify each element that we want to include.
