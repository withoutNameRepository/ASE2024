 Here is a Python function that meets the specification:
```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[52:71+1]

#print(all_ints_inclusive([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]))
```
#This code defines a function called "all_ints_inclusive" that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the list of all elements from index 52 to index 71, both inclusive. The function uses square bracket notation to access the elements of the input list and slice it using the colon operator to extract the desired sublist. Finally, the function prints the resulting sublist to the console.
