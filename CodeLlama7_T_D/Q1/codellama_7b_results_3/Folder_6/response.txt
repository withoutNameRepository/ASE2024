 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[91:99+1]
```
Explanation:

The function takes in a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all elements from index 91 to index 99, both inclusive.

The indexing operation is used to extract the desired portion of the list. The slice notation is used to specify the range of indices that we want to include in our output. In this case, we want to include all elements from index 91 to index 99, both inclusive.

To ensure that we include all elements from index 91 to index 99, we use the "+" operator to concatenate an empty list with the slice of the original list. This ensures that we get a complete list of all elements from index 91 to index 99, both inclusive.
