 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[80:201]
```
Explanation:

The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a new list that contains all elements from index 80 to index 200, both inclusive.
To achieve this, the function uses slicing syntax to extract the desired range of elements from the input list. The slice `my_list[80:201]` selects all elements in the range between indexes 80 and 200 (both inclusive), resulting in a new list that contains only the desired elements.
Note that the triple backticks used to delimit the Python code are a feature of Stack Overflow, and do not affect the actual behavior of the code.
