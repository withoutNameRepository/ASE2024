 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[59:97+1]
```
Explanation:
The `all_ints_inclusive` function takes a list of integers as an argument. It then returns the sublist of the original list that starts from index 59 and ends at index 97, both inclusive. The `+1` in the end is used to include the element at index 97 in the returned sublist.
