def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[34:56]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. The function returns the elements from index 34 to index 55, both inclusive. This is done by using slicing notation with a step size of 1, which retrieves all the elements between the specified indices.
