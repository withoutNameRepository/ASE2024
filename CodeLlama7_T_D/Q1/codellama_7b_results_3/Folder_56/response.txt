 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as an argument. It uses slicing to create a copy of the original list, and then returns the copy. The colon in the slice notation indicates that we want to include all elements up to and including the last element of the list. Therefore, the function returns a list of all elements from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive.
