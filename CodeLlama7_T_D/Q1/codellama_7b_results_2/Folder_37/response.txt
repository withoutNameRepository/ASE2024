 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Get the index of the first element that is not an integer
    first_non_int = next((i for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if not isinstance(x, int)), len(my_list))
    # Return the list of all elements from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive
    return my_list[first_non_int:]
```
