 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[0:1]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all elements from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. To achieve this, we use slicing syntax to extract the first element from the list and return it in a new list.
