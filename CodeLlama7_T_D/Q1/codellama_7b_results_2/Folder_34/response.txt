def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[60:201]
```
Explanation:

The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as its argument, and returns a new list that contains all elements from index 60 to index 200, both inclusive.
To achieve this, the function uses slicing syntax to extract the desired portion of the input list. The `:` operator is used to specify the start and end indices of the slice, with `60` as the start index and `201` as the end index (inclusive).
