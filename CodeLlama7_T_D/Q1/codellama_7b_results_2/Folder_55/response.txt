 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:11]
```
Explanation:
The function `all_ints_inclusive` takes a single argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 0 to index 10, both inclusive.
We use the slicing notation to retrieve the first 11 elements of the input list. The `:11` part of the slice indicates that we want to include the last element in the slice, even if it falls outside the range specified by `[:]`.
Note that this function will raise an error if the input list is not a list of integers. If you need to handle non-integer inputs, you can use the `try` block and catch the appropriate exception.
