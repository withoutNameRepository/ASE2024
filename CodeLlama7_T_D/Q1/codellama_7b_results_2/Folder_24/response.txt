 ```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[68:87+1]
```
Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of elements from index 68 to index 86, both inclusive.
We use slicing to extract the desired elements from the input list. The slice starts at index 68 (inclusive) and ends at index 87 (exclusive), so we add a +1 to the end of the slice to include the element at index 87 in the output.
