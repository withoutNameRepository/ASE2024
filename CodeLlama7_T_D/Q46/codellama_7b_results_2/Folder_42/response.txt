def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    # Calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 19, 69 and 97
    gcf = my_list[19]
    for i in range(20, len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % gcf == 0:
            continue

        else:

            gcf = 1

            break

    return gcf
```
Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the code:
* The function takes a list of positive integers as its only argument.
* We initialize the greatest common factor (gcf) to the value at index 19 in the list, which is the third number.
* In the for loop, we iterate over all the elements in the list starting from index 20.
* For each element at an index i greater than or equal to 20, we check if it is divisible by the current value of gcf. If it is not, we set the value of gcf to 1 and break out of the loop. This happens when the greatest common factor is found to be different from 1, which means that the element at index i is not a multiple of the current value of gcf.
* Once the loop is exited, the function returns the value of gcf, which is the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 19, 69 and 97 in the list.
