def gcf_three_nums(my_list):

    gcf = my_list[13]
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if i != 13:
            gcf = gcd(gcf, my_list[i])
    return gcf

    # Calculate the greatest common divisor of two positive integers

    while b:

        a, b = b, a % b

    return a
```
Here is an explanation of how the function works:

* First, we define a new function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers.
* In the body of the function, we first calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 13, 70 and 32 using the function `gcd`.
* Then we iterate over the rest of the elements in the list using a for loop. For each element, we calculate its greatest common divisor with the current value of the variable `gcf` using the function `gcd`. If the value of the variable `gcf` changes during this process, then we update the value of the variable `gcf` to be equal to the new greatest common factor.
* Finally, we return the value of the variable `gcf` as the result of the function.
