def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    # Find the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 62, 96 and 26
    gcf = 1
    for i in range(62, 97, 26):
        if my_list[i] % gcf == 0 and my_list[i + 26] % gcf == 0:

    return gcf
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 62, 96 and 26.
To calculate the GCF, we start with `gcf` equal to 1, and then iterate over the elements at indices 62, 96 and 26. For each element, we check if it is divisible by the current value of `gcf`, and if so, we update `gcf` to be the new divisor. Once we have iterated over all three elements, the value of `gcf` will be the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 62, 96 and 26.
