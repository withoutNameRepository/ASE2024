This code defines a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 20, 51 and 62 in the given list. The GCF is defined as the largest number that divides all three numbers without leaving a remainder.
