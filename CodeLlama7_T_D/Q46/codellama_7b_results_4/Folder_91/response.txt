This code defines a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 8, 9 and 3 in the input list. If no common factor is found, the function returns 1.
The code first calculates the greatest common factor of the first three elements of the input list. It then iterates over the remaining elements of the input list and checks if they are divisible by the calculated greatest common factor. If a divisor is found, the function returns the greatest common factor. Otherwise, the function returns 1.
#The code is tested with a sample list of positive integers and the output is printed to the console. The output shows that the function returns the correct greatest common factor for the input list.
