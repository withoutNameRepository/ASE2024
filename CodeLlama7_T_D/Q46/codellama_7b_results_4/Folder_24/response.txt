This code defines a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 18, 37 and 43. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the elements of the list starting from index 18 and calculates the greatest common factor as it iterates through the indices. Once the loop is finished, the function returns the calculated greatest common factor.
