This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 85, 36 and 54. It calculates this value by starting with the greatest common factor of two adjacent elements (initially the element at index 85) and then iteratively updating it to be the greatest common factor of three or more adjacent elements.
