This code defines a function `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 695, 710 and 914. The function calculates the greatest common factor by iterating over all pairs of elements in the range `[695, 710]` and comparing their products with the product of the three elements at indices 695, 710 and 914. If a pair of elements has a product that is less than or equal to the product of the three elements at indices 695, 710 and 914, then the greatest common factor is updated accordingly. The function returns the final value of the greatest common factor.
