This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor of three numbers. The function takes a list of integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 87, 20 and 36.
The code first initializes the greatest common factor variable gcf to the value of the element at index 87. Then it loops through the elements at indices 20 to 36. If the element at the current index is not divisible by gcf, then the loop continues to the next iteration. If the element at the current index is divisible by gcf, then the loop terminates and the function returns gcf as the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 87, 20 and 36.
The function can be tested with a list of integers as input. For example, if we provide the function with a list containing the numbers 12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 12, 34, 56, 78, 90, then the function will return 12 as the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 87, 20 and 36.
