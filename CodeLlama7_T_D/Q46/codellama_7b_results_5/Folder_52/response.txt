This function takes a list of positive integers as input. It then calculates the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 19, 49 and 74. The GCF is calculated by multiplying the elements at these three indices together, and then finding their greatest common divisor using the `gcd` function.
This function returns the GCF of the elements at indices 19, 49 and 74 in the input list.
