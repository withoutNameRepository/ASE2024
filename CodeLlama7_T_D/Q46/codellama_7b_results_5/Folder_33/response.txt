 ```
def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
gcf = 1
for i in range(252, 564 + 1):
if my_list[i] % gcf == 0 and my_list[149] % gcf == 0 and my_list[564] % gcf == 0:
return gcf
gcf += 1
```
This code first checks if the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices `252`, `149`, and `564` is equal to 1. If it is, then it increments the GCF by 1 until it finds a value that satisfies the condition.
Once the correct GCF is found, the function returns it.
