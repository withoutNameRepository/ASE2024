def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    # Calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 29, 53 and 42
    gcf = my_list[29]
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % gcf == 0:

Note that this code assumes that the list has at least 3 elements, and that all elements are positive integers. If these assumptions do not hold, the code may produce incorrect results or raise errors.
