Note: This code uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of three numbers. The GCF is defined as the largest positive integer that is a common divisor of two or more numbers. In this case, the function takes a list of positive integers and returns the GCF of the elements at indices 0, 8 and 3.
