def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    # Calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 70, 41 and 20
    gcf = 1
    for i in range(70, 20, -1):
        if my_list[i] % gcf == 0 and my_list[41] % gcf == 0 and my_list[20] % gcf == 0:

```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument. It then calculates the greatest common factor (gcf) of the elements at indices 70, 41 and 20 using a for loop that iterates from index 70 to index 20 in descending order. If the current value at the iterator is divisible by gcf and the values at indices 41 and 20 are also divisible by gcf, then the function breaks out of the for loop and returns gcf as the greatest common factor.
