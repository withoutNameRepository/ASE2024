 ```
def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    # Calculate the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 62, 96 and 26
    gcf = None
    for i in range(62, 97, 26):
        if gcf is None:
            gcf = my_list[i]
        else:
            gcf = gcd(gcf, my_list[i])
    return gcf
```
Note that this code assumes that the list of positive integers contains at least 97 elements (starting from index 0). If the list is shorter than this, the function will raise an IndexError exception.
