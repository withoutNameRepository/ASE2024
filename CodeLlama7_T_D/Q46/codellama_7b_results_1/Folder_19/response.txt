This code defines a function `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers. The function returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 40, 15 and 99.
The function first finds the minimum value among the three numbers and then starts iterating from 2 to the minimum value. During each iteration, the function checks if all three numbers are divisible by the current number `i`. If they are, the function updates `gcf` to be equal to `i`.
Once the function has finished iterating through all possible values of `i`, it returns the final value of `gcf`, which is the greatest common factor of the three numbers.
