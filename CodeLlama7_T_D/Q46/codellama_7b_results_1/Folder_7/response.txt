```
This code defines a function `gcf_three_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 477, 696 and 663. The function uses the `math.gcd()` method to calculate the greatest common divisor of three numbers.
#To test the function with a sample list of positive integers, we create a list called `my_list` that contains the specified elements. We then call the `gcf_three_nums()` function with `my_list` as input and print the output to the console. The output should be `9`, which is the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 477, 696 and 663 in the sample list.
