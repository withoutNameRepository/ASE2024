 ```
def filter_chars(s):
    result = ""
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i] > '8' and s[i] < 'm':
            continue

        result += s[i]

    return result

```
This code defines a function `filter_chars` that takes a single argument, a string. It then iterates over the characters in the given string, starting from index 1 (exclusive). If the current character is greater than '8' and smaller than 'm', it skips to the next iteration without adding the current character to the result string.
Otherwise, it adds the current character to the result string. The function then returns the altered string after all characters have been processed.
