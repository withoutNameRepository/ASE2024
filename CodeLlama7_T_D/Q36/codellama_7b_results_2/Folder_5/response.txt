 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    result = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is not between 55 and 66 (exclusive) or it is not greater than 'f' or smaller than '|', append it to the result string
        if not (55 < ord(char) < 66) or (ord(char) > ord('f')) or (ord(char) < ord('|')):
            result += char
    return result
```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is the input string. It iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop, and appends each character to an empty string called `result` if it meets the criteria specified in the problem statement (i.e., the current character is not between 55 and 66 (exclusive) or it is not greater than 'f' or smaller than '|'). Finally, the function returns the altered string.
