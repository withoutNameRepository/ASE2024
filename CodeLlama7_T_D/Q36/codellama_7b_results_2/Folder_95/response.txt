 ```
def filter_chars(string):
    filtered_string = ""
    for i in range(56, 86):
        if string[i] > '+' and string[i] < 'w':
            continue

        else:

            filtered_string += string[i]

    return filtered_string

```
Explanation:

The function takes a single argument, a string, which is the input string that needs to be filtered.

The function first creates an empty string called `filtered_string` to store the filtered output.

Then, it loops through each character in the input string between indices 56 and 86 (both exclusive).

For each character, it checks if the character is greater than '+' and smaller than 'w'. If it is not, then it adds the character to the `filtered_string`.

If the character is greater than '+' and smaller than 'w', then it does not add it to the `filtered_string`. Instead, it continues to the next iteration of the loop.

At the end of the loop, the function returns the `filtered_string`, which contains all the characters from the input string that were not between indices 56 and 86 (both exclusive).
