 Here is a Python function that meets the requirements specified in the text specification:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    result = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the given string
    for c in s:
        # Check if the current character is between 1 and 6 (both exclusive)
        if 1 < ord(c) < 7:
            # If so, remove all occurrences of that character from the result string
            result = result.replace(c, "")
        else:
            # Otherwise, add the current character to the result string
            result += c

    return result
```
This function takes a single argument `s`, which is a string. It then iterates over each character in the given string using a for loop. For each character, it checks if the character is between 1 and 6 (both exclusive) using the built-in `ord()` function to convert the character to its ASCII code value. If the character is between 1 and 6, the function removes all occurrences of that character from the result string using the `replace()` method. Otherwise, the function adds the current character to the result string. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
