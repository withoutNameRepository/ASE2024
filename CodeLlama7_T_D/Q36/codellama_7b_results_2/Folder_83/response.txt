 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string that is the same length as the original string
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over the characters in the original string
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # If the character is between 72 and 93 (inclusive) and not '<' or 'J', remove all occurrences of that character from the filtered string
        if 72 <= ord(c) < 94 and c != "<" and c != "J":
            filtered = filtered.replace(c, "")
    # Return the filtered string
    return filtered
```
This function first creates an empty string `filtered` that will be used to store the characters of the original string after removing any characters between 72 and 93 (inclusive) and not '<' or 'J'.
It then iterates over the characters in the original string using a loop. For each character `c`, it checks if its ASCII code is between 72 and 93 (inclusive) and not '<' or 'J'. If this condition is true, it removes all occurrences of that character from the filtered string by replacing it with an empty string.
Finally, the function returns the filtered string.
