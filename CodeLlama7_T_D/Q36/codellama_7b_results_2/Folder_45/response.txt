The `filter_chars` function takes a string as input and returns an altered version of the string that removes all occurrences of characters between indices 81 and 86 (both exclusive) while keeping the order of all characters intact. The function uses a loop to iterate through each character in the string, and uses the `isalpha()` method to check if a character is an alphabetical character. If a character is not an alphabetical character, it is added to the filtered string without modification. If a character is an alphabetical character, but its index is between 81 and 86 (both exclusive), the function skips that character by using the `continue` keyword. Finally, if a character is neither an alphabetical character nor one of the characters between indices 81 and 86 (both exclusive), it is added to the filtered string without modification.
