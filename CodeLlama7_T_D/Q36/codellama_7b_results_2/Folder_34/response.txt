 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string for the filtered result
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        # If the current character is between 10 and 79 (exclusive) and is greater than '?' and smaller than 'm', remove all occurrences of this character from the filtered result
        if 10 <= ord(c) <= 79 and c > "?" and c < "m":
            filtered = filtered.replace(c, "")
        # Otherwise, add the current character to the filtered result
        else:
            filtered += c

    # Return the altered string with all occurrences of characters between 10 and 79 (exclusive) removed
    return filtered
```
