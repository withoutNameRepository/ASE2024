 ```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Define the range of characters to remove
    start = ord('(') + 1
    end = ord('O') - 1
    # Create a new string with the removed characters
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if not (start <= ord(char) < end):
            result += char

    return result
```
Note that this code uses the `ord` function to convert character strings into integers representing their Unicode code points. This allows us to compare characters based on their position in the alphabet, rather than their literal value.
