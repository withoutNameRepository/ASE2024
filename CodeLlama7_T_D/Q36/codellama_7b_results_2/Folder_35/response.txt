 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function in Python:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any occurrences of '(' or ']'
    filtered = ''
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] != '(' and s[i] != ']':
            filtered += s[i]
    return filtered
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, and returns a new string with the same characters as `s`, but without any occurrences of the characters '(' or ']'. The filtering is done in place, so that the original string `s` is not altered.
