Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character between the indices $2 and $3 (both exclusive) in the given string, if that character is greater than character '$0' and smaller than character '$1', the function should remove all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters in the string intact. The function should return the altered string.
