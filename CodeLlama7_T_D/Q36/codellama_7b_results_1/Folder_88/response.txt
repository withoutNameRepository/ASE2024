 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(string):
    # Create a new string with the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in string:
        # If the current character is between 78 and 81 (exclusive)
        if char >= "S" and char < "[":
            # Skip this character in the filtered string
            continue

        # Otherwise, add the current character to the filtered string
        filtered += char

    # Return the filtered string
    return filtered
```
This implementation uses a loop to iterate over each character in the input string. For each character, it checks if it is between 78 and 81 (exclusive), and if so, skips that character in the filtered string. Otherwise, it adds the current character to the filtered string. Finally, it returns the filtered string.
