 ```
def filter_chars(string):
    filtered = ""
    for i in range(1, len(string)):
        if string[i] > ',' and string[i] < 'f':
            continue

        else:

            filtered += string[i]

    return filtered
```
The `filter_chars` function takes a single argument, a string, and returns an altered version of the string in which all occurrences of characters between the indices 1 and 6 (both exclusive) have been removed while keeping the order of all characters intact. The function uses a for loop to iterate through each character in the given string, and if the current character is greater than the comma (',') and smaller than the letter 'f', the function removes all occurrences of that character within the string by using the `continue` statement. If the current character does not satisfy the condition, it is added to the filtered string by using the `+=` operator. The final filtered string is returned from the function.
