 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered characters
    filtered_chars = []

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:

        # If the current character is between 43 and 69 (both exclusive) and is greater than 'B' and smaller than 'r', remove all occurrences of this character from the input string
        if ((ord(char) > 42 and ord(char) < 70)) and char.isalpha():
            filtered_chars.append(char)
    return "".join(filtered_chars)
```
This function takes a single argument `s`, which is the input string. It then iterates over each character in the input string using a for loop, and checks if the current character is between 43 and 69 (both exclusive) and is greater than 'B' and smaller than 'r', using the `ord()` function to convert characters to integers. If the current character meets these conditions, it is appended to a list called `filtered_chars`. After iterating over all characters in the input string, the `filtered_chars` list is joined back into a single string and returned by the function.
