 ```
def filter_chars(string):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the filtered characters
    filtered_chars = []
    # Iterate through each character in the string
    for char in string:
        # If the current character is greater than '<' and smaller than '>', remove all occurrences of that character within the string
        if char > '<' and char < '>':
            filtered_chars.append(char)
    # Join the filtered characters to form a new string
    return "".join(filtered_chars)
```
This code creates a function called `filter_chars` that takes a single argument, a string. The function then iterates through each character in the string using a for loop, and checks if the current character is greater than '<' and smaller than '>'. If it is, the function removes all occurrences of that character within the string by appending it to an empty list called `filtered_chars`. Finally, the function joins the filtered characters back together into a new string using the "".join() method.
