 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any occurrences of ':' or 'Q'
    new_str = ""
    for char in s:
        if char != ":" and char != "Q":
            new_str += char
    return new_str
```
