 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the given string
    for c in s:
        # If the current character is not between 56 and 86 (exclusive) or if it is less than '+' or greater than 'w', then add it to the filtered string
        if c < "5" or c > "8" or c == "+":
            filtered += c

    # Return the filtered string
    return filtered
```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. It iterates over each character in the given string using a for loop, and checks if the current character is not between 56 and 86 (exclusive) or if it is less than '+' or greater than 'w'. If this condition is met, then the function adds the current character to the filtered string.
Once the for loop has completed its iteration over the characters in the given string, the function returns the filtered string.
