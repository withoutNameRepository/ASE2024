 ```
def filter_chars(string):
    filtered_string = ""
    for i in range(39, 87):
        if string[i] > "!" and string[i] < "}":

        else:

            filtered_string += string[i]

    return filtered_string
```
This code defines a function called `filter_chars` that takes a single argument, a string. The function uses two nested for loops to iterate through the characters in the given string and remove any characters that are between the indices 39 and 87 (both exclusive) and are greater than character '!' and smaller than character '}'. If a character is found to be within the specified range, it is removed from the string. If a character is not found to be within the specified range, it is added to the filtered string. The function then returns the altered string.
