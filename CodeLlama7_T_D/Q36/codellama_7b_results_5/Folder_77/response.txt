 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with all characters removed
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for c in s:
        if c == '-' or c == 'v':
            # If the current character is '-' or 'v', skip it and move on to the next character
            continue

        filtered += c

    return filtered
```
