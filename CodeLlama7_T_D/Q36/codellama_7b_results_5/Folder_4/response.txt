 ```
def filter_chars(s):
    result = ''
    for i in range(42, 67):
        if s[i] > '6' and s[i] < 'g':
            continue

        else:

            result += s[i]

    return result

```
This code defines a function `filter_chars` that takes a single argument `s`, which is assumed to be a string. The function iterates over the indices between 42 and 67 (both exclusive) in the given string, and for each character at one of these indices, checks whether it is greater than '6' and smaller than 'g'. If this condition is true, the function skips that character in the resulting altered string. Otherwise, the character is added to the altered string as it was originally. The function then returns the altered string.
