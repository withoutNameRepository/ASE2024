 Here's a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(string):
    # Create a list of characters in the string
    char_list = list(string)
    # Loop through each character in the list
    for i, char in enumerate(char_list):
        # Check if the character is between 44 and 68 (both exclusive)
        if 44 < ord(char) < 68:
            # Remove all occurrences of the character from the list
            char_list = [c for c in char_list if c != char]
    return "".join(char_list)
```
This code first creates a list of characters in the input string. It then loops through each character in the list and checks if it is between 44 and 68 (both exclusive). If it is, the function removes all occurrences of that character from the list. Finally, the function joins the remaining characters in the list back into a single string and returns it.
