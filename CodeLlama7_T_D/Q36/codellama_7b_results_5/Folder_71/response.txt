 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as s, but without any characters that are greater than '*' and smaller than '['
    filtered = ""
    for char in s:
        if char > "*" and char < "[":
            continue
        else:
            filtered += char
    return filtered
```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. It then iterates over each character in the string using a for loop, and checks whether the character is greater than '*' and smaller than '[' using the standard comparison operators. If it is, the function continues to the next iteration of the loop. If it is not, the function adds the character to a new string called `filtered`, and then returns that string at the end of the function.
