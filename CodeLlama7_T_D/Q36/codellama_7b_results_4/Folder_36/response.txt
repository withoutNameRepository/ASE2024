 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to hold the filtered characters
    result = ''

    # Iterate over each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is between 'l' and 't' (exclusive), remove all occurrences of that character from the input string
        if 'l' < char < 't':
            result += s[0:-1]

        # Otherwise, add the current character to the filtered string
        else:
            result += char

    # Return the filtered string
    return result
```
