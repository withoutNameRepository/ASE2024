 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as the input string
    new_string = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the current character is between indices 69 and 97 (both exclusive)
        if 69 < s[i] < 97:
            # If it is, remove all occurrences of that character within the string
            new_string += s[:i] + s[i+1:]
    return new_string
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if it is between indices 69 and 97 (both exclusive). If it is, it removes all occurrences of that character within the string. The function then returns the altered string.
