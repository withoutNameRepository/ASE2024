 ```
def filter_chars(my_string):
    filtered_string = ""
    for i in range(len(my_string)):
        if my_string[i].isalpha() and (ord(my_string[i]) > ord('A') and ord(my_string[i]) < ord('i')):
            continue

        else:

            filtered_string += my_string[i]

    return filtered_string

# Example usage:
my_string = "Hello, world! This is a test string with some characters that should be removed."
#print(filter_chars(my_string))
```
This code will work as long as the input string contains only letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and spaces. If there are any other characters in the input string, they may not be filtered correctly.
