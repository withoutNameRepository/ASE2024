 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    for i in range(13, 40):
        if s[i] > ':' and s[i] < 'C':
            continue

        else:

            filtered += s[i]

    return filtered
```
