 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with all characters removed
    # that are between 283 and 484 (both exclusive)
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the original string

    for c in s:
        # If the current character is not between 283 and 484,

        if ord(c) < 283 or ord(c) > 484:
            filtered += c

    return filtered
```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is the string that needs to be filtered. It creates a new string `filtered` that is empty and iterates over each character in the original string using the `for c in s:` loop. If the current character is not between 283 and 484 (both exclusive), it adds the character to the `filtered` string. Finally, the function returns the filtered string.
