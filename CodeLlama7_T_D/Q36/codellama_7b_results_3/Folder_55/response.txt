 ```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is between the indices 3 and 5 (both exclusive) and it is greater than 'Y' and smaller than 's', then remove all occurrences of that character from the input string while keeping the order of all characters intact.
        if 3 < len(filtered) < 5 and char > 'Y' and char < 's':
            filtered = filtered.replace(char, "")

        # Otherwise, append the current character to the filtered string
        else:
            filtered += char

    # Return the altered string
    return filtered

```
Note that this code uses the `len` function to get the length of the filtered string, and it uses the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of a character from a string.
