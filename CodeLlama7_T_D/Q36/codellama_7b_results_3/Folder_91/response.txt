 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with all occurrences of '$' and '?' removed
    result = ''
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] != '$' and s[i] != '?':
            result += s[i]
    return result
```
This function takes a string as input, and returns a new string with all occurrences of the characters '$' and '?' removed. The function uses a loop to iterate over each character in the original string, and appends each character that is not '$' or '?' to the resulting string.
