 ```
def filter_chars(string):
    filtered = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if 26 < ord(char) < 80:
            continue

        else:

            filtered += char

    return filtered

```
This code uses the `ord()` function to get the Unicode code point of each character in the input string. Then, it checks whether each character falls within the specified range (26 < x < 80) and skips those characters if they don't. If a character is within the range, it's included in the output string.
This solution satisfies all the criteria you mentioned.
