 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(s):
    # Get the indices of the characters between 54 and 92
    start = ord('5') - 1
    end = ord('X') + 1
    # Initialize an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ''

    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the current character is between 54 and 92 (exclusive)
        if start <= ord(s[i]) <= end:
            # If it is, skip over all occurrences of that character within the string
            while i < len(s) and s[i] == s[i + 1]:
                i += 1

        else:
            filtered += s[i]

    return filtered

```
This function takes a single argument, `s`, which is a string. It then uses the `ord` function to convert each character in `s` into its corresponding ASCII code. From there, it checks if each ASCII code is between 54 and 92 (exclusive). If it is, it skips over all occurrences of that character within the string using a while loop. Finally, it returns an empty string if no characters are removed from `s`, or a filtered version of `s` if some characters were removed.
