 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create a new string with the same characters as the original string
    new_string = ""
    # Iterate over each character in the original string
    for char in s:
        # If the current character is greater than '&' and smaller than 'c', remove it from the new string
        if char > '&' and char < 'c':
            continue

        # Otherwise, add the current character to the new string
        else:
            new_string += char
    return new_string
```
