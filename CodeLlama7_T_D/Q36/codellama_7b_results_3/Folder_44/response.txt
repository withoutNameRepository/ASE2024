 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```
def filter_chars(string):
    for i in range(18, 64):
        if string[i] > '3' and string[i] < 'B':
            string = string[:i] + string[i+1:]
    return string
```
This function takes a single argument `string`, which is assumed to be a non-empty string. The function then iterates over the characters in the string between indices 18 and 64 (both exclusive), and for each character that meets the condition mentioned in the text specification, the function removes all occurrences of that character within the string while keeping the order of all characters intact. Finally, the function returns the altered string.
