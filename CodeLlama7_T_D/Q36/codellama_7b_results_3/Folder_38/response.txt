 Here is a possible implementation of the `filter_chars` function:
```python
def filter_chars(s):
    # Create an empty string to store the filtered characters
    filtered = ""

    # Iterate over each character in the given string
    for c in s:
        # If the current character is not between the indices 44 and 48 (both exclusive)
        if not (44 < ord(c) < 48):
            # Append the current character to the filtered string
            filtered += c

    # Return the filtered string
    return filtered
```
