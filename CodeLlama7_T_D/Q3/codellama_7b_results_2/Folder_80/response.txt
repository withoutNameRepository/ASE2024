Explanation:

The function `all_pos_ints_inclusive` takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all positive integers from index 64 to index 66, both inclusive.
To find the first positive integer in the list, we use the built-in `next()` function with a generator expression that iterates over the elements of the list until it finds a positive integer. We then store the result in the variable `first_pos_int`.
Similarly, to find the last positive integer in the list, we use the built-in `next()` function with a generator expression that iterates over the elements of the list in reverse order until it finds a positive integer. We then store the result in the variable `last_pos_int`.
Finally, we return the list of all positive integers from index 64 to index 66, both inclusive, using a list comprehension that iterates over the elements of the input list within the specified range and returns only those elements that are greater than zero.
