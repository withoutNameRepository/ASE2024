 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_pos_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the positive integers
    pos_ints = []
    # Iterate over the list of integers from index 33 to index 36, both inclusive
    for i in range(33, 37):
        # Check if the current element is a positive integer
        if my_list[i] > 0:
            # If it is, add it to the list of positive integers
            pos_ints.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the list of all positive integers from index 33 to index 36, both inclusive
    return pos_ints
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is a Python list of integers, and that the indices are valid for the given list. If the input list or indices are not valid, the function may produce unexpected results or errors.
