def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Create a new list to store the positive integers
    pos_ints = []
    # Iterate through the list and append any positive integers to the new list
    for i in range(27, 56):
        if my_list[i] > 0:
            pos_ints.append(my_list[i])

    return pos_ints
```
This code defines a function `all_pos_ints_inclusive` that takes a single argument, a list of integers, and returns a list of all the positive integers from index 27 to index 56, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.
The code works by iterating through the input list and checking each element to see if it is positive. If the element is positive, it is added to a new list called `pos_ints`. This new list is then returned by the function.
