    pos_ints = []
    # Iterate through the list and append any positive integers to the 'pos_ints' list
    for i in range(10, 67):
        if my_list[i] > 0:

```
This code defines a function called `all_pos_ints_inclusive` that takes a single argument of type list. The function first initializes an empty list called `pos_ints` to store all the positive integers from index 10 to index 66, both inclusive. It then iterates through the input list and appends any positive integers to the `pos_ints` list. Finally, it returns the `pos_ints` list.
Here's an example usage of this function:
```
# Test the function with a sample input list
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
positive_integers = all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list)
#print(positive_integers)
```
#This code defines a sample input list `my_list` with the first ten elements being zeros. It then calls the `all_pos_ints_inclusive` function and passes in the `my_list` as an argument. Finally, it prints out the returned list of all positive integers from index 10 to index 66, both inclusive.
