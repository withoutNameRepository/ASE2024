Explanation:
The function `all_pos_ints_inclusive` takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. The function returns the list of all positive integers from index `66` to index `93`, both inclusive. If there are no positive integers in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
The function first checks if there are any positive integers in the specified range using the `any()` function with a generator expression that checks if each integer is greater than 0. If there are no positive integers in the range, the function returns an empty list by using the `return` statement without any arguments.
If there are positive integers in the specified range, the function uses list comprehension to return the list of all positive integers from index `66` to index `93`, both inclusive. The list comprehension generates a new list that contains only the positive integers from the original list that fall within the specified range.
