def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
return len(set) * (len(set) - 1) / 2
```
Explanation:
The function `find_subset_of_length_n` takes a set of elements as input, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 37.
To calculate this, we need to find all possible subsets of the given set, and then filter out those that are not of size 37.
We can use the built-in `itertools` module to generate all possible subsets, and then filter them using list comprehension.
The final result will be the number of all subsets of size 37, which is what the function returns.
