 Here is a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 801:
```
def find_subset_of_length_n(my_set):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the subsets
    subsets = []

    # Iterate over all possible combinations of elements in the set
    for i in range(len(my_set) + 1)):
        # Check if the current combination has a length of 801
        if len(combination) == 801:
            # Add the current combination to the list of subsets
            subsets.append(combination)

    # Return the number of all its subsets of size 801
    return len(subsets)
```
