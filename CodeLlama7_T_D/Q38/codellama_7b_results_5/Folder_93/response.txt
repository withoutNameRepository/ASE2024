def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
    # Initialize the number of subsets as 0

    # Iterate over all possible combinations of 45 elements from the set
    for combination in itertools.combinations(set, 45):
        # If the current combination is a subset, increase the number of subsets by 1

```
The `find_subset_of_length_n` function takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 45. The function uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible combinations of 45 elements from the set. Then it checks if each combination is a subset by using the `is_subset` function. If the current combination is a subset, the number of subsets is increased by 1. Finally, the function returns the total number of subsets of size 45.
