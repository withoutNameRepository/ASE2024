def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
return (2 ** len(s)) - (len(s) + 1)
```
Explanation:
The function takes a set of elements `s` as input and returns the number of all its subsets of size 73.
The formula for calculating the number of subsets is: `(2 ^ n) - (n + 1)`
Here, `n` is the length of the set `s`, which is given as an argument to the function.
So, the function calculates the number of all subsets of size 73 by using the formula and returns the result.
