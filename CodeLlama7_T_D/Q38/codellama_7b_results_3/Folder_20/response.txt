 ```
def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
    n = len(s)
    # Initialize the number of subsets as 1
    num_subsets = 1
    # Loop through all possible combinations of elements in s
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1):
            # Check if the combination is a subset of size 53
            if (j - i) == 53:
                num_subsets += 1
    return num_subsets
```
This code uses a recursive approach to find all possible combinations of elements in the given set, and then checks each combination to see if it is a subset of size 53. The function returns the number of such subsets.
