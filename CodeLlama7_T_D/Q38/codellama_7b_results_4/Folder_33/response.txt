This function takes a set of elements as an argument and returns the number of all its subsets of size n. It does this by first calculating the total number of subsets possible using the formula 2^n, where n is the number of elements in the set. Then it filters out all subsets that are not of size n using list comprehension. Finally, it returns the length of the filtered subset to get the number of all its subsets of size n.
