def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
return len(set(itertools.combinations(s, n))))
```
This function takes a set of elements as input and returns the number of all its subsets of size 380. It uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all possible combinations of elements from the input set, and then filters out those that do not have exactly 380 elements using the `len()` function. The final result is the number of all subsets of size 380.
