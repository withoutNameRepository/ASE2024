This code defines a function called `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size `n`.
The function uses a bitwise operation to iterate over all possible subsets of the given set. For each subset, the function checks if it has length `n`, and if so, increments a counter to keep track of the total number of subsets of size `n`.
Finally, the function returns the value of the counter, which represents the total number of subsets of size `n` in the given set.
