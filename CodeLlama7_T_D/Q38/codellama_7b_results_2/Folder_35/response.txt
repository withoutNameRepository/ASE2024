This function takes a set of elements as input and returns the number of all its subsets of size 300. The function first iterates through all possible combinations of 300 elements from the input set, using the binary representation of each combination to determine which elements are included in the subset. It then adds each subset to a list of subsets and returns the length of this list at the end.
