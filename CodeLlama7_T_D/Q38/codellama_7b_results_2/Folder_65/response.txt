 ```
def find_subset_of_length_n(my_set):
    # Calculate the number of subsets of size n
    num_subsets = 2**len(my_set)
    # Filter out subsets of size n
    filtered_subsets = [subset for subset in my_set if len(subset) == n]
    return len(filtered_subsets)
```
Explanation:

The function takes a set of elements as an argument. It calculates the number of all subsets of size 35 using the formula 2**len(my_set). Then, it filters out all subsets that are not of size 35 and returns the length of the remaining subset.
