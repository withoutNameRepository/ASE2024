 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_subset_of_length_n` function in Python:
```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    # Initialize a list to store all subsets
    all_subsets = []

    # Iterate over each element in the set
    for element in elements:
        # Initialize an empty list to store this subset
        current_subset = []

        # Add the current element to the subset
        current_subset.append(element)

        # Recursively find all subsets of length 34 starting from the current element
        find_subsets_of_length_n(elements, 34, current_subset)

    return len(all_subsets)

def find_subsets_of_length_n(elements, n, current_subset):
    # Base case: if the length of the subset is equal to n, add it to the list of all subsets
    if len(current_subset) == n:
        all_subsets.append(current_subset)

    # Recursive case: iterate over each element in the set and add it to the current subset
    for element in elements:
        # If the element is not already in the subset, add it
        if element not in current_subset:
            current_subset.append(element)

            # Recursively find all subsets of length n starting from the current subset
            find_subsets_of_length_n(elements, n, current_subset)

            # Remove the last element added to the subset
            current_subset.pop()
```
