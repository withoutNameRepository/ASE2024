def find_subset_of_length_n(s):
return len(set(itertools.combinations(s, n))))```
This function takes a set of elements as an argument and returns the number of all its subsets of size n.
The function uses the itertools library to generate all possible combinations of elements in the input set, and then counts the number of subsets of length n using the len() function.
