 ```
def find_subset_of_length_n(set, n):
return len(set) ** (n + 1)
```
This function takes a set of elements and an integer `n` as input. It returns the number of all subsets of size `n`.
The function uses the mathematical formula for counting subsets. Specifically, it calculates the total number of subsets of size `n`, which is equal to the number of ways to choose `n` elements from the set. This is done by taking the length of the set (`len(set)`) raised to the power of `n + 1`.
For example, if we have a set with three elements and we want to find all subsets of size two, we can use this function as follows:
```
find_subset_of_length_n([1, 2, 3], 2)
```
This will return the number `9`, which is equal to the total number of subsets of size two in a set with three elements.
