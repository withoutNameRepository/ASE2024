 ```
def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
return len(set) ** (1 / 78)
```
Explanation:
The function takes a set of elements as input and returns the number of all its subsets of size 78.
The formula for calculating the number of subsets of a set with n elements is:
len(set) ^ (1 / n)
where len(set) is the length of the set, and n is the size of the subset.
In this case, we are finding the number of all subsets of a given set, where each subset has 78 elements. Therefore, we take the length of the input set as n, and use the formula to calculate the number of subsets.
