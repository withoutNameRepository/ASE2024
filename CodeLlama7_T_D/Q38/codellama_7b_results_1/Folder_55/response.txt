def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
    return len(set) * (len(set) - 1) / 2
```
This function takes a set of elements as an argument, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 21. The formula used to calculate this is based on the concept of selecting two elements from a set of n elements in total.
