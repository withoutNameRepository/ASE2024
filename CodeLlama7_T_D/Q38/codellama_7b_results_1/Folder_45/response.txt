 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_subset_of_length_n` function:
```
def find_subset_of_length_n(my_set):
# Initialize an empty list to store all subsets
all_subsets = []
# Loop through each element in the set
for element in my_set:
# Create a new subset by adding the current element to it
new_subset = [element]
# Recursively call the function with the same set and a size of 32
all_subsets += find_subset_of_length_n(my_set, 32)
return all_subsets
```
This implementation uses recursion to generate all subsets of a given set. The `find_subset_of_length_n` function takes two arguments: the first is the set of elements to be used in generating the subsets, and the second is the size of the subsets to be generated (in this case, 32).
The implementation works by using a loop to iterate through each element in the input set. For each element, it creates a new subset by adding the current element to it, and then recursively calls itself with the same set and a size of 32 (i.e., the same set but with a size of 32 for the subsets). The resulting sets are concatenated into a single list and returned as the result of the function.
