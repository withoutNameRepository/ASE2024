 ```
def find_subset_of_length_n(set_elements):
# Initialize a list to store all subsets of size 32
subsets = []
for i in range(len(set_elements) - 31)):
# Add the first 32 elements of the set to the current subset
subsets.append(set_elements[i:i + 32]))
return len(subsets))
```
This code defines a function called `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 32.
The function first initializes an empty list to store all subsets of size 32.
Then, it iterates over the set of elements and for each element, it adds the next 32 elements to the current subset. If there are less than 32 elements left in the set, it adds the remaining elements to the subset.
Finally, the function returns the number of subsets that were added to the list.
