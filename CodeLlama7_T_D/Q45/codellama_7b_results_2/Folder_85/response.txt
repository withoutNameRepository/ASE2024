This code defines a function called `palindromes_between_indices` that takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 7 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 2 to index 8, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.
The code first initializes an empty set to store the palindromes. It then loops through each character in the string, starting from index 2. For each character, it checks if the substring starting from index 2 to the current character (i.e., index i - 1) is a palindrome using the `is_palindrome` function. If the substring is a palindrome, it adds the palindrome to the set of palindromes.
The `is_palindrome` function checks if the string is equal to its reverse. It does this by returning `True` if the string is equal to its reverse, and `False` otherwise. This ensures that only palindromes are added to the set of palindromes.
