def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(2, len(string)):
        # Check if the substring starting at index i and ending at index i is a palindrome
        if string[i:] == string[i:][::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(string[i:])
    return palindromes
```
This code uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string. It then checks if the substring starting at the current index and ending at the end of the string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If it is a palindrome, it adds it to an empty set that will store all the palindromes found. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.
