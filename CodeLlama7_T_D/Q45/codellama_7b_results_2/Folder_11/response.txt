 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each substring of the given string
    for i in range(3, len(string) - 2):
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome
        if string[i:i+1] == string[i-1:i]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(string[i-1:i+1])
    return palindromes
```
This implementation uses a loop to iterate through each substring of the given string, starting from the third index. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing its first and last characters. If the substring is a palindrome, it adds it to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.
