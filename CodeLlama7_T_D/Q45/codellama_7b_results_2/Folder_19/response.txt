 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over the possible combinations of letters between indices 1 and 7
    for i in range(1, len(string) - 6):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(string) - 5):
            word = string[i:j+1]
            # Check if the word is a palindrome
            if word == word[::-1]:
                # Add the word to the set of palindromes
                palindromes.add(word)
    return palindromes
```
This implementation first initializes an empty `set` to store the palindromes. It then iterates over all possible combinations of letters between indices 1 and 7 in the input string. For each combination, it checks if the word formed by these letters is a palindrome. If it is, it adds the word to the set of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes.
