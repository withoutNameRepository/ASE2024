 Here is the Python code for the function `palindromes_between_indices`:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over the characters in the string
    for i in range(2, len(string)):
        # Check if the substring starting at index 2 and ending at index i is a palindrome
        if string[i] == string[i-1] and string[i] == string[i-2]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(string[i-2:i+1])
    return palindromes
```
This code iterates over the characters in the given string, checking if each substring starting at index 2 and ending at index `i` is a palindrome. If it is, then the function adds the palindrome to an empty set of palindromes that will be returned by the function. If no such palindromes can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur between indices 2 and 5, inclusive, then the function returns an empty set.
