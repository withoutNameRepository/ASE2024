 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(s):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Get the substring starting from index i and ending at index 5 (inclusive)
        substr = s[i:i+6]
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome
        if substr == substr[::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(substr)
    return palindromes
```
This function takes in a string `s` as input, and it returns the set of all palindromes of length at least 6 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in `s` that occur between indices 0 to 5, both inclusive. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.
For example, if we call the function with the string "racecar", it will return the set of palindromes {"racecar", "racecar"}. If we call the function with the string "cat", it will return an empty set because there are no palindromes of length at least 6 that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in "cat".
