 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string, start, end):
    # Create a set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        # Check if the current character is a letter
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Create a lowercase version of the character
            lower_case = string[i].lower()
            # Loop through each character in the string again
            for j in range(start, end + 1):
                # Check if the current character is the same as the lowercase version we created earlier
                if string[j] == lower_case:
                    # Create a substring of the current character and the previous characters
                    substring = string[i:j+1]
                    # Check if the substring is a palindrome
                    if substring == substring[::-1]:
                        # Add the palindrome to the set
                        palindromes.add(substring)
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
