 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(string) - 4):
        # Check if the substring starting at index i and ending at index i + 4 is a palindrome
        if string[i:i + 5] == string[i:i + 5][::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(string[i:i + 5])
    return palindromes
```
This function first initializes an empty set to store the palindromes. It then loops through each character in the string, starting at index 4 and ending at the length of the string minus 4. For each character, it checks if the substring starting at that index and ending at index i + 4 is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If it is a palindrome, it adds it to the set. Finally, it returns the set of all palindromes found in the string.
