 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Create a list of all possible substrings
    # of length at least 7 between indices 2 and 9
    substrings = [string[i:j+1] for i in range(2, len(string)-8) for j in range(i+2, len(string)-6)]
    # Filter out substrings that are not palindromes
    palindromes = []
    for substring in substrings:
        if substring == substring[::-1]:
            palindromes.append(substring)
    return set(palindromes)
```
This function first creates a list of all possible substrings of the given string that are between indices 2 and 9 (inclusive). It then filters out any substrings that are not palindromes, and returns the resulting set of palindromes.
