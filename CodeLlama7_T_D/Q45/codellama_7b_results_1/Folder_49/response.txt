 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for i in range(5, len(string)):
        # Check if the current character is a letter
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Get the index of the first occurrence of the letter in the string
            first_index = string.find(string[i])
            # Get the index of the last occurrence of the letter in the string
            last_index = string.rfind(string[i])
            # Check if the letter appears at least twice in the string
            if last_index - first_index >= 1:
                # Get the substring that contains all the letters between the first and last occurrence of the letter
                substring = string[first_index + 1:last_index]
                # Check if the substring is a palindrome
                if substring == substring[::-1]:
                    # Add the palindrome to the set
                    palindromes.add(substring)
    return palindromes
```
This code first initializes an empty `set` called `palindromes` to store all the palindromes that can be created from the given string. It then iterates over each character in the string using a loop, and checks if the current character is a letter using the `isalpha()` method. If it is a letter, the code gets the index of the first occurrence of the letter in the string using the `find()` method, and the index of the last occurrence of the letter in the string using the `rfind()` method. It then checks if the letter appears at least twice in the string by subtracting the indices of the first and last occurrences of the letter. If the letter appears at least twice, the code gets the substring that contains all the letters between the first and last occurrence of the letter using the `substring` method, and checks if the substring is a palindrome using the `==` operator. If it is a palindrome, the code adds it to the set of palindromes using the `add()` method. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.
