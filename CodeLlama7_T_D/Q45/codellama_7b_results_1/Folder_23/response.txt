 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(s):
    # Create a set to store all the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each substring of length 4 or more in the input string
    for i in range(len(s) - 3):
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome
        if s[i:i+4] == s[i:i+4][::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(s[i:i+4])
    return palindromes
```
This function takes a string `s` as input, and returns a set of all palindromes of length 4 or more that can be created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in `s` that occur between index 0 to index 6, both inclusive. The function forms each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function returns an empty set.
