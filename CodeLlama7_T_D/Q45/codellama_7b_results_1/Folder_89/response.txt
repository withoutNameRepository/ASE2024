 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Check if the current character is a letter
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Get the indices of all occurrences of the current letter in the string
            indices = [j for j, l in enumerate(string) if l == string[i]]
            # Iterate over each occurrence of the current letter
            for j in indices:
                # Check if the letter is surrounded by letters on both sides
                if 5 <= j < 9 or (j == 0 and 5 <= string[1] <= 8) or (j == len(string) - 1 and 5 <= string[-2] <= 8):
                    # Get the substring that contains the current letter and its surroundings
                    substring = string[max(0, j - 3):min(len(string), j + 4)]]
                    # Check if the substring is a palindrome
                    if substring == substring[::-1]:
                        # Add the palindrome to the set
                        palindromes.add(substring)
    # Return the set of all palindromes found in the string
    return palindromes
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a string. It then iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is a letter. If it is, the function gets the indices of all occurrences of that letter in the string and iterates over each occurrence. For each occurrence, the function checks if the letter is surrounded by letters on both sides (i.e., if the letter is part of a palindrome). If it is, the function adds the substring that contains the current letter and its surroundings to the set of all palindromes found in the string. Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes found in the string.
