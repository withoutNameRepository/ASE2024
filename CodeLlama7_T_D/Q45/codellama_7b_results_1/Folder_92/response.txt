 Here's a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each possible subsequence of the string
    for i in range(4, len(string) - 3):
        # Check if the subsequence is a palindrome
        if string[i:i+4] == string[i:i+4][::-1]:
            # If it is, add it to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(string[i:i+4])
    return palindromes
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character.
The function first initializes an empty set to store the palindromes.
Next, the function loops through each possible subsequence of the string using the `range` function with the `start` and `stop` parameters set to 4 and the length of the string minus 3, respectively. This allows the function to consider all possible subsequences of the string that are at least 4 characters long.
For each possible subsequence, the function checks if it is a palindrome by comparing the subsequence with its reverse. If the subsequence is a palindrome, the function adds it to the set of palindromes.
Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.
