 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(s):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop over all possible substrings of length 7 or more
    for i in range(len(s) - 7 + 1):
        substring = s[i:i+7]
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome
        if substring == substring[::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(substring)
    return palindromes
```
This code uses a loop to iterate over all possible substrings of length 7 or more in the input string `s`. For each substring, it checks if it is a palindrome by comparing its reverse with itself. If the substring is a palindrome, it adds it to an empty set `palindromes` that stores all the palindromes found. Finally, the function returns the set of palindromes.
