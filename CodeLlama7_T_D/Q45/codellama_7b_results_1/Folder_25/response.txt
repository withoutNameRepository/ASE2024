This function takes a single argument, which is a string. The function then iterates through each possible sub-string of length at least 3 in the given string using a nested loop. For each sub-string, the function checks if it is a palindrome by comparing its characters on both sides. If the sub-string is a palindrome, the function adds it to an empty set called `palindromes`. Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes that can be created from the English letters of the given string in the specified range.
