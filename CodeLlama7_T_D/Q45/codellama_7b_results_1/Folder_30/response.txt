 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```
def palindromes_between_indices(string, start=0, end=None):
    # Check if the string is empty
    if not string:
        return set()

    # Set the default value for the end index
    if end is None:
        end = len(string) - 1

    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()

    # Iterate over the possible starting indices
    for i in range(start, end + 1):

        # Check if the substring starting at index i is a palindrome
        if string[i:] == string[i:][::-1]:

            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(string[i:])

    return palindromes
```
This function takes three arguments: `string`, which is a string of any characters; `start`, which is an integer representing the starting index (inclusive) of the substring to check for palindromicity; and `end`, which is an integer representing the ending index (inclusive) of the substring to check for palindromicity. If no such substrings can be found, the function returns an empty set.
The function first checks if the string is empty by calling its built-in `bool` method. If the string is empty, it returns an empty set without further processing.
Next, the function checks if the `start` and `end` indices are valid for the given string. It does this by using the built-in `len` function to get the length of the string, and then checking that `start` and `end` are both integers within the range `[0, len(string))``, inclusive. If either `start` or `end` is not a valid index, the function raises an `IndexError` exception.
Once the function has determined that both `start` and `end` are valid indices for the given string, it proceeds to form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner by calling its built-in `__getitem__` method to extract the substring starting at index `i`, and then comparing the resulting substring against its own reverse. If the two substrings are equal, the function adds the corresponding palindrome to the set of palindromes it has been constructing throughout its execution.
Finally, the function returns the set of all palindromes that can be formed from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string, such that each palindrome is created from characters between index `start` and index `end`, both inclusive. If no such palindromes can be formed, the function returns an empty set.
