 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(s):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each possible length of a palindrome
    for i in range(6, len(s) + 1):
        # Get the substring of the given string that occurs between indices 1 and i
        sub_str = s[1:i]
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome
        if sub_str == sub_str[::-1]:
            # Add the palindrome to the set
            palindromes.add(sub_str)
    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a string `s`. It then loops through each possible length of a palindrome between 6 and the length of the given string plus one. For each possible length, it gets the substring of the given string that occurs between indices 1 and the current length, and checks if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reversed form. If it is a palindrome, it adds it to an empty set `palindromes` to store all the palindromes found. Finally, it returns the set of palindromes in a case-insensitive manner.
