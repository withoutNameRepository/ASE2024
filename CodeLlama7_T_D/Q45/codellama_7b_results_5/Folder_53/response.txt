 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(s):
    # Define the range of indices to consider
    start = 4
    end = 8
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over the possible starting positions
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        # Generate all possible palindromes of length at least 6
        for j in range(i, end + 1):
            # Check if the substring from index i to index j is a palindrome
            if s[i:j] == s[i:j][::-1]:
                # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
                palindromes.add(s[i:j])
    # Return the set of palindromes in a case-insensitive manner
    return {x.lower() for x in palindromes}
```
This code first defines the range of indices to consider, which is from index 4 to index 8, both inclusive. It then initializes an empty set to store the palindromes.
The code then iterates over the possible starting positions within this range. For each starting position, it generates all possible palindromes of length at least 6 by iterating over the possible ending positions within this range.
The code checks if the substring from the starting position to the ending position is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse. If it is a palindrome, it adds it to the set of palindromes.
Finally, the code returns the set of palindromes in a case-insensitive manner by converting each palindrome to lowercase before adding it to the set.
