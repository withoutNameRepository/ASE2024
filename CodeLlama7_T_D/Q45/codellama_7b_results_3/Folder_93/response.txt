 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(s):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each substring of length 6 or greater in the input string
    for i in range(len(s) - 5):
        # Extract the substring starting at index i and of length 6 or greater
        sub_str = s[i:i+6]
        # Check if the substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse
        if sub_str == sub_str[::-1]:
            # If the substring is a palindrome, add it to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(sub_str)
    # Return the set of palindromes that can be created from the English letters in the input string between indices 2 and 7, inclusive
    return palindromes
```
