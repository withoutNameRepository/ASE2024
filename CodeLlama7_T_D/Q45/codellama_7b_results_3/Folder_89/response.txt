 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Create a list of all possible palindromes of length at least 6
    palindromes = []
    for i in range(5, len(string) - 5):
        # Check if the substring starting from index i and ending at index i + 11 is a palindrome
        if string[i:i+11] == string[i:i+11][::-1]:
            # If it is a palindrome, add it to the list of palindromes
            palindromes.append(string[i:i+11])
    return set(palindromes)
```
This function takes one argument, which is a string. It then iterates over the indices of the string that are at least 5 positions apart from each other (the starting and ending indices of the substring to be checked for palindromicity). For each such index, it checks if the substring starting from that index and ending at index i + 11 is a palindrome. If it is, it adds it to the list of palindromes. Finally, it returns the set of all palindromes in the list.
