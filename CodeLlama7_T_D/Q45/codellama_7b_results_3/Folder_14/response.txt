 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function in Python:
```
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over each character in the given string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Check if the current character is between indices 4 and 5 (inclusive)
        if 4 <= i <= 5:
            # Create a substring of the given string starting from the current index and ending at the length of the string
            substr = string[i:]
            # Iterate over each character in the substring
            for j in range(len(substr)):
                # Check if the current character is not equal to the last character of the substring
                if substr[j] != substr[-1]:
                    # Add the palindrome created from the current character and the last character of the substring to the set of palindromes
                    palindromes.add(substr[:-1] + substr[j])
    return palindromes
```
The function takes one argument, which is a string. The given string may consist of any character. The function should return the set of all palindromes of the length of at least 3 such that each palindrome is created from any possible arrangement of the English letters in the given string that occur between index 4 to index 5, both inclusive. If no such palindromes of the specified length can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur in the specified range, the function should return an empty set. The function should form each palindrome in a case-insensitive manner.
