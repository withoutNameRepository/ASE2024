 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Get the current character and its case-insensitive equivalent
        char = string[i]
        insensitive_char = char.lower() if char.isupper() else char.upper()
        # Loop through each character in the string that comes after the current one
        for j in range(i + 1, len(string)):
            # Get the next character and its case-insensitive equivalent
            next_char = string[j]
            insensitive_next_char = next_char.lower() if next_char.isupper() else next_char.upper()
            # Check if the current character is the same as the next character in a case-insensitive manner
            if char == insensitive_next_char:
                # If the current character is the same as the next character, form a palindrome by reversing the order of the characters in the string between the current index and the next index
                palindrome = ''.join(reversed(string[i:j + 1]))
                # Add the formed palindrome to the set of palindromes
                palindromes.add(palindrome)
    # Return the set of palindromes that can be created from the English letters of the given string that occur between index 0 to index 5, both inclusive
    return palindromes
```
