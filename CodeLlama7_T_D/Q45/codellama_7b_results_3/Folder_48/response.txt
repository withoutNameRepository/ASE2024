 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```
def palindromes_between_indices(string, start_index, end_index):
    # Create a set to store all palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Iterate over the indices in the specified range
    for i in range(start_index, end_index + 1):
        # Get the character at the current index
        char = string[i]
        # If the character is not a letter, skip to the next index
        if not char.isalpha():
            continue

        # Iterate over the indices in the specified range again
        for j in range(start_index, end_index + 1):
            # Get the character at the current index
            other_char = string[j]
            # If the character is not a letter, skip to the next index
            if not other_char.isalpha():
                continue

            # Create a palindrome by concatenating the two characters
            palindrome = char + other_char

            # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(palindrome)

    # Return the set of palindromes
    return palindromes
```
This implementation first creates an empty set to store all palindromes that can be created from the English letters in the given string between the specified indices.
Next, it iterates over the indices in the specified range and gets the character at each index. If the character is not a letter (i.e., it is not uppercase or lowercase), the program skips to the next index and continues with the next iteration of the loop.
Once the program has reached an index that corresponds to a letter, it iterates over the indices in the specified range again, this time starting from the next index after the previous iteration. This allows the program to generate all possible palindromes that can be created by concatenating two letters.
Finally, the program adds each palindrome that has been generated to the set of palindromes. Once all possible palindromes have been generated and added to the set, the program returns the set of palindromes as the result of the function.
