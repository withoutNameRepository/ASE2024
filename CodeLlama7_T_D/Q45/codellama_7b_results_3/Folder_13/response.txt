 Here is a possible implementation of the `palindromes_between_indices` function:
```python
def palindromes_between_indices(string):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the palindromes
    palindromes = set()
    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(3, 10):
        # Check if the current character is a letter or not
        if string[i].isalpha():
            # Create a palindrome by reversing the letters between index 3 and index 9
            palindrome = "".join(reversed(string[3:10]))
            # Add the palindrome to the set of palindromes
            palindromes.add(palindrome)
    return palindromes
```
