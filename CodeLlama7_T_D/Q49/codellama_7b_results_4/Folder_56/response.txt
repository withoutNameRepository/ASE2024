```
This code uses the `int` constructor to convert the binary representation of the decimal integer to a Python integer. It then initializes a list `fib` with the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (0 and 1). The function then calculates the 84th number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two numbers in the list. Finally, it checks if the decimal integer is divisible by the 84th number in the Fibonacci sequence by using the modulo operator (%). If the result of the modulo operation is 0, then the decimal integer is divisible by the 84th number in the Fibonacci sequence.
