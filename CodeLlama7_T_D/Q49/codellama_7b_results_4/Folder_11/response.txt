 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_decimal_is_divisible` function:
```
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):
    # Convert the binary representation to an integer
    decimal_integer = int(binary_representation, 2)
    # Initialize variables for keeping track of the Fibonacci sequence
    previous_number = 0
    current_number = 1

    # Iterate through the digits of the decimal integer
    # and check if the number is divisible by the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence
    for digit in str(decimal_integer):
        # Check if the digit is a zero, since in this case the number is not divisible by any number in the Fibonacci sequence
        if digit == '0':
            return False

        else:
            # If the digit is non-zero, check if it is divisible by the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence
            if current_number % previous_number ** 16 == 0:
                return True

            else:
                # If the digit is not divisible by the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence, move on to the next digit
                previous_number = current_number
                current_number = current_number + previous_number

    # If all digits have been checked and none of them were found to be divisible by the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence, return False
    return False
```
This code first converts the binary representation string to an integer using the `int` function. It then initializes two variables to keep track of the current and previous numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
The code then iterates through the digits of the decimal integer using a for loop, and checks if each digit is divisible by the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence. If any digit is found to be divisible by this number, the function returns `True`.
If all digits have been checked and none of them were found to be divisible by the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence, the function returns `False`.
