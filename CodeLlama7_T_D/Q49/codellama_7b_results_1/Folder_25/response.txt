 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_decimal_is_divisible` function in Python:
```python
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_rep):
    # Convert the binary representation to an integer
    decimal_int = int(binary_rep, 2)
    # Compute the Fibonacci sequence up to the 19th term
    fib_seq = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, 19):
        fib_seq.append(fib_seq[i - 1] + fib_seq[i - 2])
    # Check if the decimal integer is divisible by the 19th term of the Fibonacci sequence
    return decimal_int % fib_seq[18] == 0
```
This implementation first converts the binary representation to an integer using the `int` function with a base of 2. It then computes the Fibonacci sequence up to the 19th term using a loop, and stores the resulting sequence in a list called `fib_seq`. Finally, it checks if the decimal integer is divisible by the 19th term of the Fibonacci sequence by computing the remainder of dividing the decimal integer by the 19th term. If the remainder is equal to 0, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
