 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_decimal_is_divisible` function in Python:
```
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):
    # Convert the binary representation to a decimal integer
    decimal_integer = int(binary_representation, 2)
    # Initialize the Fibonacci sequence with the first two numbers
    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]
    # Compute the 180th number in the Fibonacci sequence
    for i in range(180):
        fibonacci_sequence.append(fibonacci_sequence[-2] + fibonacci_sequence[-1])
    # Check if the decimal integer is divisible by the 180th number in the Fibonacci sequence
    return decimal_integer % fibonacci_sequence[180] == 0
```
The `if_decimal_is_divisible` function takes a single argument, which is a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer. The function then converts the given binary representation to a decimal integer using the `int()` built-in function with a base of 2 (i.e., the binary numeral system).
The function then initializes the Fibonacci sequence with the first two numbers, which are 0 and 1, respectively. The function then computes the 180th number in the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence together until the desired index is reached (i.e., the 180th number).
The function then checks if the decimal integer that was given as an input is divisible by the 180th number in the Fibonacci sequence. If the given decimal integer is divisible by this number, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
