 Here is a possible implementation of the `if_decimal_is_divisible` function:
```
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the Fibonacci sequence and the divisibility check
    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1]
    divisibility_check = True

    # Iterate through the binary representation of the decimal integer
    for digit in binary_representation:
        # If the current digit is a "1", update the divisibility check accordingly
        if digit == "1":
            divisibility_check = not divisibility_check

        # Update the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two numbers together
        fibonacci_sequence.append(fibonacci_sequence[-2] + fibonacci_sequence[-1]))

    # Return the result of the divisibility check, taking into account the starting value of the Fibonacci sequence
    return divisibility_check and (fibonacci_sequence[0] == 0 or fibonacci_sequence[1] == 1))
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate through the binary representation of the decimal integer, updating the divisibility check accordingly. It also maintains a separate variable to keep track of the Fibonacci sequence, and updates it appropriately as the loop progresses. Finally, it returns the result of the divisibility check, taking into account the starting value of the Fibonacci sequence.
