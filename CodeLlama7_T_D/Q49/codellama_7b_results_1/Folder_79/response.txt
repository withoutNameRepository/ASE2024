def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_string):
    # Convert the binary string to an integer

    # Get the Fibonacci sequence up to the 13th number
    fibonacci_sequence = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

    return (decimal_integer % fibonacci_sequence[12]) == 0
```
This code first converts the binary string to an integer using the `int()` function. It then gets the Fibonacci sequence up to the 13th number using a list comprehension, where the first element is 0 and the second element is 1. The code then checks if the decimal integer is divisible by the 13th Fibonacci number by using the modulo operator (`%`) and checking if the result is equal to 0.
