 Here's a possible implementation of the `if_decimal_is_divisible` function:
```
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_rep):
    # Convert the binary representation string to an integer
    decimal_int = int(binary_rep, 2)
    # Initialize variables for the Fibonacci sequence
    a = 0
    b = 1

    # Iterate through the Fibonacci sequence until we reach the 45th number
    while len(str(a)) < 45:
        c = a + b
        a = b
        b = c

    # Check if the decimal integer is divisible by the 45th number in the Fibonacci sequence
    if (decimal_int % int(str(a)[-45:]))) == 0:
        return True

    else:

        return False
```
This code first converts the binary representation string to an integer using the `int` function with a base of 2. It then initializes variables for the Fibonacci sequence, starting with the first two numbers (0 and 1). The code uses a while loop to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence until we reach the 45th number.
Once we have reached the 45th number in the Fibonacci sequence, the code checks if the decimal integer is divisible by the 45th number using the modulo operator (`%`). If the decimal integer is divisible by the 45th number, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
