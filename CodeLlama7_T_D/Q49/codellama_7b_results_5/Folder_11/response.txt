 Here's a possible implementation of the `if_decimal_is_divisible` function:
```python
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_repr):
    # Convert the binary representation to an integer
    decimal_int = int(binary_repr, 2)
    # Calculate the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence
    fib16 = (5 * 5 + 4) // 10
    # Check if the decimal integer is divisible by the 16th Fibonacci number
    return decimal_int % fib16 == 0
```
This function takes a binary representation string as input, converts it to an integer using the `int` constructor, and then calculates the 16th number in the Fibonacci sequence using the formula given in the problem statement. Finally, the function checks if the decimal integer is divisible by the 16th Fibonacci number by calculating its remainder when divided by `fib16`. If the remainder is zero, then the decimal integer is divisible by the 16th Fibonacci number, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.
