    # Check if decimal integer is divisible by the 108th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence
    while c < decimal_integer:

```
This code uses a simple loop to iterate through the Fibonacci sequence until it finds the number that is equal to or greater than the given decimal integer. It then checks if the given decimal integer is divisible by this number, and returns True or False accordingly.
