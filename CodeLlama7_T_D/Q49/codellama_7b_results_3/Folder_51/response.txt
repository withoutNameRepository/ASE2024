 Here's a possible implementation of the `if_decimal_is_divisible` function in Python:
```python
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_representation):
    # Convert the binary representation to an integer
    decimal_integer = int(binary_representation, 2)
    # Compute the 17th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence
    fibonacci_sequence = [0] + [a + b for a, b in zip(fibonacci_sequence, fibonacci_sequence[1:])]
    if len(fibonacci_sequence) < 17:
        # The Fibonacci sequence is not long enough to have the 17th number
        return False

    else:

        # Compute the remainder of dividing the decimal integer by the 17th number in the Fibonacci sequence
        remainder = decimal_integer % fibonacci_sequence[16]
        if remainder == 0:
            # The decimal integer is divisible by the 17th number in the Fibonacci sequence
            return True

        else:

            # The decimal integer is not divisible by the 17th number in the Fibonacci sequence
            return False

```
