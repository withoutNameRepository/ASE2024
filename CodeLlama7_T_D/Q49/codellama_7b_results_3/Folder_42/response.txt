def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_string):
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    decimal_integer = int(binary_string, 2)
    # Calculate the Fibonacci number that is 145 steps ahead of the previous Fibonacci number
    fib_number = 0
    for i in range(145):

Note that this code assumes that the given binary string represents a non-negative decimal integer. If the binary string is empty or contains characters other than 0 and 1, the function will raise a `ValueError`.
