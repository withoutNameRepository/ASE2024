 ```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # Find the intersection of the two lists
    intersection = list(set(list1).intersection(list2))
    # Return an empty set if there are no identical elements
    if len(intersection) == 0:
        return set()
    # Otherwise, return the set of identical elements
    else:
        return intersection

```
This code defines a function called `identical_elements` that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size. The function returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 10 and index 66, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.
The code works by first finding the intersection of the two lists using the `set` module's `intersection()` method. This produces a new list that contains only the elements that are present in both input lists.
Next, the code checks if this new list is empty. If it is, then there are no identical elements between the two input lists, and the function returns an empty set.
If the new list is not empty, then the code returns a set containing all the identical elements found between the two input lists.
