    # Create a set of all elements in list2 between indices 26 and 52 (inclusive)

```
This code defines a function called `identical_elements` that takes two arguments, both lists of the same size. The function returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists between indices 26 and 52 (inclusive). If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.
The code first checks if both lists have the same length. If they do not, the function returns an empty set immediately.
Next, the code creates two sets: `elements1` contains all elements in `list1` between indices 26 and 52 (inclusive), and `elements2` contains all elements in `list2` between indices 26 and 52 (inclusive).
Finally, the function returns the intersection of `elements1` and `elements2`. If there are no elements that occur at least once in both lists between indices 26 and 52 (inclusive), the intersection will be empty.
