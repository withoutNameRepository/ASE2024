 Here is a possible implementation of the `identical_elements` function:
```python
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # Check that both lists have the same size
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        return set()
    
    # Create a set to store the elements that occur in both lists
    common_elements = set()
    
    # Iterate over the elements of the first list
    for i in range(17, 78 + 1):
        
        # If the current element is also present in the second list, add it to the set of common elements
        if list1[i] in list2:
            common_elements.add(list1[i])
    
    # Return the set of common elements
    return common_elements
```
