 ```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # Create a set of all elements in both lists
    common_elements = set(list1).intersection(set(list2))
    # Return the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 661 and index 924, both inclusive
    return {element for element in common_elements if element in list1[661:924+1] or element in list2[661:924+1]}
```
Note that the function takes two arguments `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists of the same size. The function returns a set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 661 and index 924, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.
