 ```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # Check if both lists are of the same size
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        return set()

    # Create a set of all elements in list1
    set1 = set(list1)

    # Create a set of all elements in list2
    set2 = set(list2)

    # Return the intersection of both sets
    return set1 & set2
```
This code defines a function called `identical_elements` that takes two arguments, two lists of the same size. The function returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 19 and index 92, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.
The code first checks if both lists are of the same size. If they are not, the function returns an empty set immediately.
Next, the code creates two sets from the input lists. The first set contains all the elements that occur at least once in `list1`. The second set contains all the elements that occur at least once in `list2`.
The code then finds the intersection of both sets using the `&` operator. This gives us the set of all elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`, anywhere between index 19 and index 92, both inclusive.
Finally, the function returns the resulting set.
