 ```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
return {x for x in list1 if x in list2}
```
Explanation:
The function `identical_elements` takes two arguments `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of the same size. The function uses a set comprehension to iterate over both lists simultaneously, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 2 and index 2, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function returns an empty set.
