 Here is a possible implementation of the `identical_elements` function in Python:
```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    common_elements = set1 & set2
    return common_elements
```
This code first converts both input lists into sets. This is because the `set` data structure provides an efficient way to check whether a given element exists in the set or not.
Next, the code uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets. The result is a new set that contains all elements that are present in both input lists.
Finally, the function returns the resulting set. If no common elements were found between the two input lists, an empty set is returned instead.
