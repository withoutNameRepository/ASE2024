 Here is a possible implementation of the `identical_elements` function:
```python
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # Check if both lists have the same length and return an empty set if not
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        return set()

    # Initialize an empty set to store the elements that occur at least once in both lists
    identical_elements = set()

    # Loop through the elements of list1 and check if they occur in list2
    for element in list1:
        if element in list2:
            identical_elements.add(element)

    # Return the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists
    return identical_elements
```
This implementation first checks if the two lists have the same length, and if not, it returns an empty set. Then it initializes an empty set to store the elements that occur at least once in both lists. It then loops through the elements of list1 and checks if they occur in list2. If an element occurs in both lists, it is added to the `identical_elements` set. Finally, the function returns the `identical_elements` set containing all elements that occur at least once in both lists.
