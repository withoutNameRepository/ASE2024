 ```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # Create a set of all elements in both lists
    common_elements = set(list1).intersection(set(list2))
    # Return the set of identical elements between indices 56 and 82
    return {element for element in common_elements if element in list1[56:83] and element in list2[56:83]}
```
Note that this solution assumes that both lists have at least one element between indices 56 and 82. If either list has fewer than 7 elements between these indices, the function will return an empty set.
