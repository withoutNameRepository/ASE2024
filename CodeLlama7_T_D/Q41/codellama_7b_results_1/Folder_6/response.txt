 Here is a Python function that satisfies the text specification:
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
\# check if both lists are of the same size and have at least 10 elements
if len(list1) != len(list2) or len(list1) < 10:
return set()
\# create a set of all elements in both lists
elements = set(list1).intersection(set(list2))
\# filter out any elements that do not occur at least once in both lists between index 10 and index 66, both inclusive
filtered_elements = {element for element in elements if list1.count(element) >= 10 and list2.count(element) >= 10}
return filtered_elements
