 ```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the common elements
    common_elements = set()

    # Iterate over both lists simultaneously and check for common elements
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        if list1[i] in list2:
            common_elements.add(list1[i])

    return common_elements

```
This code will iterate over the two lists simultaneously, using a nested loop to check for common elements between the two lists. If an element is found in both lists, it will be added to the `common_elements` set. Finally, the function returns the `common_elements` set.
