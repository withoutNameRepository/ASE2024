This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function first converts the input string into a list of characters. Then, it finds the indices of the characters in the list that occur between indices 20 and 30 (inclusive). Finally, it sorts the indices based on the ASCII value of the corresponding character and returns the character with the 8th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the list that occur between indices 20 to 30 (inclusive).
