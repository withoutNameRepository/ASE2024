This function takes a single argument `s`, which is a string of distinct characters. The function first gets the indices of the characters in the string that occur between indices 10 and 73, both inclusive. It then creates a list of all the ASCII values of the characters in the string between the given indices. Finally, it sorts the list of ASCII values in ascending order and returns the character with the 9th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 10 and 73, both inclusive.
