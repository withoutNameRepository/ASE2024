This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function first finds the indices of the characters that occur between 37 and 59, both inclusive. It then creates a list of all the characters in the specified range, sorts them by their ASCII values, and returns the 6th smallest ASCII value among the characters in the specified range.
