 ```
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):
    # Create a list of the ASCII values of each character in the string
    ascii_values = [ord(char) for char in string]
    # Get the indices of the characters that occur between 12 and 55
    indices = [index for index, value in enumerate(ascii_values) if 12 <= value <= 55]
    # Sort the ASCII values based on their indices
    sorted_ascii_values = sorted(ascii_values, key=indices.index)
    # Return the character with the 17th smallest ASCII value
    return chr(sorted_ascii_values[16])
```
Note that this function assumes that there are at least 17 characters in the string that occur between indices 12 and 55, both inclusive. If there are fewer than 17 such characters, the function will raise an IndexError.
