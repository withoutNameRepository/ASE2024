 ```
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):
    # Extract the characters between indices 50 and 75
    characters = string[50:76]
    # Convert the characters to ASCII values
    ascii_values = [ord(c) for c in characters]
    # Find the nth smallest ASCII value
    nth_smallest = sorted(ascii_values)[6]
    # Return the character with the nth smallest ASCII value
    return chr(nth_smallest)
```
This code uses the `ord()` function to convert each character in the string to its corresponding ASCII value. It then sorts the list of ASCII values and returns the 7th smallest value (the 6th is the 50th smallest, so the 7th is the 75th smallest). Finally, it converts the ASCII value back to a character using the `chr()` function.
