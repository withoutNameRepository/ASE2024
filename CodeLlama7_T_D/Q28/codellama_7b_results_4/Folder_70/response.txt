def return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):
# Create a list of the unique characters in the string
unique_chars = list(set(string))
# Sort the list of unique characters by their ASCII values

```
This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function first creates a list of the unique characters in the string using the `set()` method. Then, it sorts this list of unique characters by their ASCII values using the `sorted()` method and the `key=ord` parameter to specify the sorting key as the ASCII value of each character. Finally, the function returns the 14th character in the sorted list, which is the 14th smallest ASCII value among the unique characters in the string.
