This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a single argument, which is a string of distinct characters. The function returns the character with the 19th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 18 to 66, both inclusive.
The code first initializes a dictionary called `char_freq` to store the frequency of each character in the input string. It then iterates over the characters in the string and updates the frequency dictionary accordingly.
Once the frequency dictionary is populated, the code sorts it based on the value (descending order) using the `sorted` function with a lambda expression. The sorted dictionary is stored in a new variable called `sorted_freq`.
The final step is to return the character with the 19th smallest ASCII value from the sorted frequency dictionary. This is done by indexing into the `sorted_freq` dictionary using the index 18 and extracting the first element (character) from the resulting tuple. The resulting character is returned as the output of the function.
