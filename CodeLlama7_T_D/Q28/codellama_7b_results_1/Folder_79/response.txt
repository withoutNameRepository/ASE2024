This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function first extracts the characters between indices 13 and 35 (both inclusive) from the given string using slicing. Then it converts each character to its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. Finally, it sorts the list of ASCII values in ascending order and returns the 18th smallest ASCII value using indexing.
