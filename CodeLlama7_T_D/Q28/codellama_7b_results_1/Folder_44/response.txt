This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a string of distinct characters as its argument. The function first finds the indices of all the characters in the string using a loop. Then, it iterates over the characters between indices 20 and 30 (both inclusive) and returns the character with the 8th smallest ASCII value among those characters.
Note that this code assumes that there are no duplicates in the input string. If there are duplicates, the function may return a different character than the one with the 8th smallest ASCII value.
