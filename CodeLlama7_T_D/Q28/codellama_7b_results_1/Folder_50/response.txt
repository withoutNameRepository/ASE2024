def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):

raise ValueError("Invalid input string")

# Get a list of all characters in the input string

```
This code defines a function `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a single argument of type `str`. The function first checks if the input string is valid by checking its length. If the length is not within the expected range, the function raises a `ValueError`.
Once the input string is validated, the function extracts all the characters from the input string and stores them in a list of characters. It then sorts this list of characters by their ASCII value using the `sorted()` function with a custom key function that returns the ASCII value of each character.
Finally, the function returns the 11th smallest character in the sorted list of characters by accessing its index at position 10.
