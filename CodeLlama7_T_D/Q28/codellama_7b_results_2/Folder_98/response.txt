This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function returns the character with the 9th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 0 to 8, both inclusive.
The code first initializes a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the string. It then iterates through the characters in the string and updates the frequency dictionary accordingly.
Next, the code sorts the dictionary by value (frequency) in descending order using the `sorted` function. The sorted dictionary is then returned as the final result.
