This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes a single argument, a string of distinct characters. The function first creates a list of characters in the string between indices 17 and 65 (inclusive). It then gets the ASCII values of all the characters in the list using the built-in `ord()` function.
The next step is to sort the list of ASCII values in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function. The sorted list is then used to find the 8th smallest ASCII value in the sorted list. To do this, the code uses the built-in `index()` method to find the index of the 8th smallest ASCII value in the sorted list. Finally, the character at that index is returned as the output of the function.
