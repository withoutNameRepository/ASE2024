 ```
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):
    # Get the characters that occur between indices 3 and 26
    char_list = string[3:27]
    # Sort the list of characters by their ASCII values
    sorted_list = sorted(char_list, key=ord)
    # Return the character with the 5th smallest ASCII value
    return sorted_list[4]
```
This code should work correctly for any input string that has at least 17 distinct characters. The `return_nth_smallest_ascii` function takes a single argument, which is a string of distinct characters. It then gets the list of all the characters in the string that occur between indices 3 and 26 (inclusive), sorts the list by ASCII value, and returns the character with the 5th smallest ASCII value.
