 ```
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):
    # Find the indices of the characters in the string
    start = s.find('a', 47)
    end = s.rfind('z', 70)
    # Create a list of all the characters between the indices
    chars = [c for c in s[start:end+1] if c != ' ']
    # Sort the list of characters by their ASCII values
    chars.sort(key=ord)
    # Return the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value
    return chars[13]
```
This code will find the indices of the first and last occurrences of each letter in the string between positions 47 and 70, inclusive. Then it creates a list of all the characters that are not spaces in this substring. Finally, it sorts this list by its ASCII values and returns the character with the 14th smallest ASCII value.
