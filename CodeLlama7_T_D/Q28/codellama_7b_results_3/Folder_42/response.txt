    for char in string:
        if char in freq:
            freq[char] += 1
        else:
            freq[char] = 1
    # Sort the dictionary by value
    sorted_freq = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    # Return the character with the 13th smallest ASCII value
    return chr(sorted_freq[12][0]]))
```
This code first creates a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the input string. It then sorts this dictionary by value and uses the 13th element (index 12) to find the character with the smallest ASCII value. Finally, it converts this ASCII value back into a character using the `chr()` function and returns it.
