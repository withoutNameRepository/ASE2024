This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument: a string of distinct characters. The function first gets all the characters that occur between indices 4 to 33, both inclusive (i.e., from the fourth character to the thirtieth character). Then it sorts the characters by their ASCII values using the `sorted()` function and its `key` argument set to `ord`. Finally, it returns the character with the 4th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 4 to 33, both inclusive.
