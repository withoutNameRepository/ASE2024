def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):
    # Find the indices of the characters in the string that occur between 36 and 79
    start_idx = s.find('a', 36)
    end_idx = s.rfind('z', 36, 79)
    # Get the list of ASCII values for the characters in the string between the indices
    ascii_vals = [ord(c) for c in s[start_idx:end_idx]]
    # Sort the ASCII values in ascending order
    sorted_ascii_vals = sorted(ascii_vals)
    # Return the character with the 12th smallest ASCII value
    return chr(sorted_ascii_vals[11])
```
This code uses the `ord()` function to get the ASCII value of each character in the string. It then uses the `chr()` function to convert the ASCII values back into characters. The code also uses the `find()` and `rfind()` methods of the string class to find the indices of the characters that occur between 36 and 79.
