 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_substring_of_size_n` function:
```python
def all_substring_of_size_n(s, n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the substrings
    substrings = []

    # Loop through each character in the string
    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):
        # Extract the substring of length n starting at index i
        substring = s[i:i+n]

        # Check if the substring is already in the list
        if substring not in substrings:
            # If it's not, add it to the list
            substrings.append(substring)

    # Return the list of all distinct substrings of length n
    return substrings
```
This function takes two arguments: a string `s` and an integer `n`. It returns a list containing all the distinct substrings of length `n` that can be formed by extracting substrings from `s`. If no such substrings exist, the function returns an empty list. The order of the substrings in the returned list does not matter.
