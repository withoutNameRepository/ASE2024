def all_substring_of_size_n(string):
return [substring for substring in (string[i:i+14] for i in range(len(string)-13)) if len(substring) == 14 and len(set(substring)) == 14]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to generate all substrings of size 14 from the input string. The substrings are generated by using slicing to extract substrings of length 14 starting at each position in the input string. The resulting substrings are then filtered to only include those that have no duplicate characters and are exactly 14 characters long.
