```
This function takes two arguments: `string`, which is the input string, and `n`, which is the length of the substrings to be returned.
The function first initializes an empty list called `substrings` to store all the distinct substrings of size 44 with no duplicate characters.
Then, it loops through each substring starting from the beginning of the input string, with a step size of 1. For each substring, it checks if there are any duplicate characters in the substring using the `any` function. If there are no duplicate characters, the substring is added to the `substrings` list.
Finally, the `substrings` list is returned as the output of the function.
