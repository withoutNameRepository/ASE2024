 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_substring_of_size_n` function:
```python
def all_substring_of_size_n(s):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the substrings
    substrings = []

    # Iterate over each character in the string
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Extract the substring starting at position i and of length n
        substring = s[i:i+n]

        # If the substring is not already in the list, add it to the list
        if substring not in substrings:
            substrings.append(substring)

    # Return the list of all distinct substrings of length n
    return substrings
```
Note that this function assumes that the input string `s` is non-empty and has at least one character. If `s` is empty or has no characters, the function will return an empty list `[]`.
