 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_substring_of_size_n` function:
```python
def all_substring_of_size_n(s, n):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the substrings
    substrings = []

    # Loop through each substring of length n in the input string s
    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):

        # Add the substring to the list of substrings
        substrings.append(s[i:i+n])

    # Return the list of substrings
    return substrings
```
This implementation uses a combination of slicing and looping to extract all substrings of length `n` from the input string `s`. The resulting substrings are then stored in an empty list, which is returned at the end.
