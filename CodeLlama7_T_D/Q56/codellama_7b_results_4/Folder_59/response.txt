```
This code defines a function called `all_substring_of_size_n` that takes a string as input and returns a list of all distinct substrings of length n in the given string. The function uses a loop to iterate through each character in the string, and an if statement to check if the substring already exists in the list. If the substring does not exist, it is added to the list. Finally, the function returns the list of distinct substrings.
#The function can be tested with a string and n value as input. For example, running `print(all_substring_of_size_n("abc", 3))` will output the list `[abc]`.
