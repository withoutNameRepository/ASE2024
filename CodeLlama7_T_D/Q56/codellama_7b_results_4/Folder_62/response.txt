 ```
def all_substring_of_size_n(string):
# create a set to store the distinct substrings
substrings = set()
# loop through each character in the string
for i in range(len(string) - 2):
# extract the substring of length 32 starting from index i
substring = string[i:i+32]
# if the substring is not already in the set, add it
if substring not in substrings:
substrings.add(substring)
return list(substrings)
```
This code uses a loop to iterate through each character in the input string and extracts substrings of length 32 starting from each index. It then adds these substrings to a set, which automatically removes any duplicates. Finally, it returns the set as a list.
