 ```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list of integers
    for i in my_list:
        # Check if the current integer is between 73 and 84, both inclusive
        if 73 <= i <= 84:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += i

    # Return the sum

    return sum
```
This code defines a function `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as input. It then loops through the list and adds up all the integers that are between 73 and 84, both inclusive. If there are no such integers in the list, the function returns 0.
