def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list of integers
    for i in my_list:
        # Check if the current integer is between 10 and 79, both inclusive
        if 10 <= i <= 79:

```
This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a single argument of type `list` and returns an integer representing the sum of all integers in the given list that are between 10 and 79, both inclusive. The function first initializes a variable to store the sum, then loops through the list of integers using a `for` loop. For each integer in the list, the code checks if it is between 10 and 79, both inclusive, using the `if` statement. If an integer is found to be within this range, its value is added to the sum variable using the `+=` operator. Once all integers have been looped through and checked for their inclusion in the desired range, the function returns the value of the sum variable.
