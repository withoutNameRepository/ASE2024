 ```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list of integers
    for num in my_list:
        # Check if the number is between 138 and 858, inclusive
        if (num >= 138 and num <= 858):
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += num

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This code will take a list of integers as input and return the sum of all the integers that are between 138 and 858, inclusive. If there are no such integers in the list, the function will return 0.
