 Here is a possible implementation of the 'sum_in_range' function:
```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the elements of the list
    for element in my_list:
        # Check if the element is between 10 and 97 (inclusive)
        if 10 <= element <= 97:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += element

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
