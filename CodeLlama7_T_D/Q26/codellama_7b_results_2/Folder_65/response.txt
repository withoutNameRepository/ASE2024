def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through the list of integers
    for i in my_list:
        # Check if the current integer is between 77 and 84, both inclusive
        if 77 <= i <= 84:
            # Add the current integer to the sum
            sum += i

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 77 and 84, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.
