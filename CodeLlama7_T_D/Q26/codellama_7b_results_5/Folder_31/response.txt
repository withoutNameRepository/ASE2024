This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 60 and 97, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.
The code first initializes a variable called `sum` to store the sum of the numbers in the list. It then loops through the list of integers using the `for num in my_list:` loop. For each integer in the list, the code checks if it is between 60 and 97, both inclusive. If the current integer is within this range, it adds the current integer to the sum variable using the `sum += num` operation.
After looping through all integers in the list, the code returns the sum of the numbers in the list that are between 60 and 97, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.
Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only integer values. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function may produce unexpected results or throw an error.
