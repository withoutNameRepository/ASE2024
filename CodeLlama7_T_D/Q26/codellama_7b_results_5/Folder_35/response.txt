 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function in Python:
```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the elements of the list
    for element in my_list:
        # Check if the element is between 139 and 767
        if (element >= 139) and (element <= 767):
            # Add the element to the sum
            sum += element

    return sum
```
This implementation uses a simple `for` loop to iterate over the elements of the list, and a conditional expression (`if`) to check if each element is between 139 and 767. If it is, the element is added to the running total (which is initialized to 0 at the beginning of the function). The final return statement returns the sum of all the elements in the list that are between 139 and 767.
