 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum variable
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list and check if each element is between 90 and 97
    for i in my_list:
        if 90 <= i <= 97:
            sum += i

    return sum
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a list of integers. It then iterates over the list and checks if each element is between 90 and 97, both inclusive. If an element is found to be in this range, its value is added to the `sum` variable. The final result is returned as the sum of all elements from the given list that are between 90 and 97, both inclusive.
