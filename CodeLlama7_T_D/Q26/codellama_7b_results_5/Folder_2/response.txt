 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Iterate through the list of integers
    for num in my_list:
        # Check if the current integer is between 266 and 586 (inclusive)
        if 266 <= num <= 586:
            # If it is, add it to the total
            total += num

    # Return the sum
    return total
```
