def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize a variable to store the sum
    total = 0

    # Iterate over the list of integers
    for num in my_list:
        # Check if the current number is between -3 and 6 (both inclusive)
        if (-3 <= num <= 6):
            # If it is, add it to the total sum
            total += num

    # Return the total sum
    return total
```
This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a single argument, a list of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between -3 and 6 (both inclusive). If there are no such integers in the list, the function returns 0.
