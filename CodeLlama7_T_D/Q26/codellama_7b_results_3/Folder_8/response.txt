 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list and check if each element is between -33 and 93, both inclusive
    for i in my_list:
        if -33 <= i <= 93:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += i

    # Return the sum

    return sum
```
