def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list of integers
    for i in my_list:
        # Check if the integer is between 50 and 92, both inclusive
        if 50 <= i <= 92:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += i

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a single argument of type `list` of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 50 and 92, both inclusive. If there are no such integers in the list, the function returns 0.
