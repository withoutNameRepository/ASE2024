def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Iterate over the list of integers
    for num in my_list:
        # Check if the number is between -23 and 64, both inclusive
        if -23 <= num <= 64:
            # Add the number to the sum
            total += num

    # Return the sum
    return total

# Test the function with a list of integers
my_list = [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 23, 64]
#print(sum_in_range(my_list)) # Output: 90
```
The code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as input. The function iterates over the list and checks if each element is between -23 and 64, both inclusive. If an element is within this range, it is added to the sum. At the end, the sum is returned.
The function is tested with the list `[-10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 23, 64]`. The output of the test is `90`, which is the sum of all integers in the given list that are between -23 and 64, both inclusive.
