 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function in Python:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    total = 0
    # Loop through the list and check if each element is between 4 and 9, both inclusive
    for i in my_list:
        if 4 <= i <= 9:
            total += i

    # Return the sum
    return total
```
Note that this function takes a single argument, which is a list of integers. It returns the sum of all elements in the given list that are between 4 and 9, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain any such elements, the function returns 0.
