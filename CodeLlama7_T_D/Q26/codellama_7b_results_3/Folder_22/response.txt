 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function in Python:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum variable
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list of integers
    for num in my_list:
        # Check if the current number is between 4 and 6 (both inclusive)
        if 4 <= num <= 6:
            # Add the current number to the sum
            sum += num

    return sum
```
This code first initializes a variable `sum` to 0. It then iterates over the list of integers using a for loop, and for each integer in the list it checks if it is between 4 and 6 (both inclusive). If the current number is between 4 and 6, it adds the number to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum.
For example, if we call the `sum_in_range` function with a list of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, the function will return the sum of all integers in the range of 4 to 6 (both inclusive), which is 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 28.
