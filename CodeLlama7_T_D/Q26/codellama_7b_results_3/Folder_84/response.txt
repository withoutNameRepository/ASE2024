```
This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 113 and 392, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.
The code uses a for loop to iterate over each integer in the input list. For each integer, it checks if it is between 113 and 392 using the `if` statement. If an integer is found to be between these two numbers, its value is added to the sum variable using the `+=` operator.
The function returns the sum variable at the end of the loop. If no integers are found between 113 and 392, the function returns 0.
The code includes a few test cases to demonstrate how the function works. The first test case calls the function with an empty list as input. The second test case calls the function with a list of integers that do not contain any numbers between 113 and 392. The third test case calls the function with a list of integers that contains one number between 113 and 392, and another number outside this range.
