 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through the list of integers
    for num in my_list:
        # Check if the current number is between 28 and 96, both inclusive
        if 28 <= num <= 96:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += num

    return sum
```
Note that this function takes a single argument, which should be a list of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 28 and 96, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.
