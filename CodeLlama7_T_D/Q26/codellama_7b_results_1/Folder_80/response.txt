def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through the list of integers
    for i in my_list:
        # Check if the current integer is between -798 and -379, both inclusive
        if (-798 <= i <= -379):
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += i

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between -798 and -379, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.
