 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize variables
    total = 0
    lower_bound = 4
    upper_bound = 9

    # Iterate through the list and add elements that are within the specified range to the total
    for element in my_list:
        if lower_bound <= element <= upper_bound:
            total += element

    # Return the total sum of integers from the given list that are between 4 and 9, both inclusive
    return total
```
