This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 44 and 67 (both inclusive). If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.
The code first initializes a variable `total` to store the sum. It then iterates over the list of integers using a for loop. For each integer in the list, the code checks if it is between 44 and 67 (both inclusive) using the comparison operators `<=` and `>=` . If the current number is between 44 and 67, the code adds it to the total sum using the `+=` operator.
Finally, the code returns the total sum using the return statement. The function can be tested by calling it with a list of integers as an argument.
