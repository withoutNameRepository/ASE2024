 ```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list of integers
    for num in my_list:
        # Check if the current number is between 36 and 52, both inclusive
        if 36 <= num <= 52:
            # If it is, add it to the sum
            sum += num

    # Return the sum

    return sum

```

This code defines a function `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all integers in the list that are between 36 and 52, both inclusive. If there are no integers in the list that fall within this range, the function will return 0.
