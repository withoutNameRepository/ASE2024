 Here is a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate over the list
    for i in my_list:
        # Check if the current element is between -9 and -7
        if -9 <= i <= -7:
            # Add the element to the sum
            sum += i

    # Return the sum
    return sum
```
This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function first initializes the sum to 0, then iterates over the elements of the list using a for loop. For each element, the function checks if it is between -9 and -7 (both inclusive), and if so adds it to the sum. Finally, the function returns the sum.
Note that this code assumes that the input list only contains integers. If the list may contain other types of elements, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
