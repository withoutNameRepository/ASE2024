 Here's a possible implementation of the `sum_in_range` function:
```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Loop through the list and check if each element is between 4 and 7
    for i in my_list:
        if 4 <= i <= 7:
            sum += i

    return sum
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a list of integers. It then loops through the list and checks if each element is between 4 and 7 (both inclusive). If an element is found to be between these values, its value is added to the `sum` variable. Finally, the `sum` variable is returned as the output of the function.
