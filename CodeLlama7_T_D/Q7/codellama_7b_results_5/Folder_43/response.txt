```
This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input. The function loops through the specified range of the input list and checks if each integer is even. If an even integer is found, it is added to an empty list called `even_ints`. Once the loop is complete, the `even_ints` list is returned.
To test this code, you can create a sample list of integers and pass it as an argument to the `all_even_ints_inclusive` function. The output should be a list containing only the even integers from the specified range of the input list.
