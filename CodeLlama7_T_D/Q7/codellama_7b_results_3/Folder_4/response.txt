 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []
    # Iterate through the list and append any even integers to the list
    for i in range(12, 92 + 1):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the list of all even integers from index 12 to index 92, both inclusive
    return even_ints
```
This function first initializes an empty list called `even_ints` to store the even integers. Then it iterates through the list passed as an argument and checks if each element is even by dividing it by 2 and checking if the result is equal to 0. If the element is even, it appends the element to the `even_ints` list. Finally, the function returns the `even_ints` list.
