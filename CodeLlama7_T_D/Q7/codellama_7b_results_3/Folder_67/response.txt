 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_even_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []
    # Iterate through the list starting from index 22 (inclusive)
    for i in range(22, len(my_list)):
        # Check if the current element is even
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            # If it is even, add it to the list of even integers
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the list of all even integers in the specified range
    return even_ints
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a list of integers. It then iterates through the list starting from index 22 (inclusive) and checks if each element is even. If it is, it adds that element to a separate list of all even integers found in the specified range. Finally, it returns this list of all even integers.
