 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_even_ints_inclusive` function in Python:
```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []
    # Loop through the specified range of indices
    for i in range(21, 97 + 1):
        # Check if the current index contains an even integer
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            # If so, add it to the list of even integers
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the list of all even integers from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive
    return even_ints
```
This function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function then loops through the specified range of indices (in this case, from index 21 to index 97) and checks if each element at that index contains an even integer. If it does, the function adds the element to the `even_ints` list. Finally, the function returns the `even_ints` list containing all the even integers found in the specified range of indices.
