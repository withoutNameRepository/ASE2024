 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []

    # Iterate through the list from index 42 to index 68, both inclusive
    for i in range(42, 69):
        # If the current element is even, append it to the list of even integers
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the list of all even integers from index 42 to index 68, both inclusive
    return even_ints
```
