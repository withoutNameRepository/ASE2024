This code defines a function `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all even integers from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive. The function first initializes an empty list called `even_ints` to store the even integers. It then iterates through the specified range of the input list using the `range` function, and for each integer it checks if it is even by dividing it by 2 and checking if the remainder is 0. If the current integer is even, it is appended to the `even_ints` list. Finally, the `even_ints` list is returned as the output of the function.
