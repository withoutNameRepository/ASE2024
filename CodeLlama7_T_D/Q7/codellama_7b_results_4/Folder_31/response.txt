 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_even_ints_inclusive` function:
```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []
    # Iterate over the list from index 75 to index 88 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(75, 89):
        # Check if the current element is an even integer
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the list of even integers
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the list of all even integers from index 75 to index 88 (both inclusive)
    return even_ints
```
This function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function then iterates over the elements of this list from indices 75 to 88 (both inclusive), and checks if each element is an even integer. If it is, the element is added to the `even_ints` list. Finally, the function returns the `even_ints` list.
Note that this implementation assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the list may contain other data types, additional error checking or type conversions may be necessary to ensure that the function works correctly.
