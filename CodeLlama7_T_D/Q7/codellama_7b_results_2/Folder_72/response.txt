def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Create a new list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []

    # Iterate through the list of integers and append the even integers to the new list
    for i in range(29, 52):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:

```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is at least 30 elements long and has an even number of elements between index 29 and index 51, inclusive. If the input list does not meet these assumptions, the function may produce incorrect results or throw an error.
