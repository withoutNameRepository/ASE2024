 Here's a solution in Python:
```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []

    # Iterate through the specified range of indices
    for i in range(70, 85):

        # Check if the current index contains an even integer
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:

            # If so, add it to the list of even integers
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the list of all even integers from the specified range, or an empty list if none exist
    return even_ints
```
Note that this solution assumes that the input list is a list of integers, and that the indices in the range are valid for the input list. If either of these assumptions is not met, the function may produce incorrect results or throw an error.
