This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the list of all even integers from index 22 to index 88, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
The code first initializes an empty list called `even_ints` to store the even integers. Then it iterates through the list and appends the even integers to the `even_ints` list.
Finally, the code returns the `even_ints` list containing all even integers from index 22 to index 88, both inclusive.
