This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 100 to index 200, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
The function first creates a new list called `even_ints` to store the even integers. It then loops through the list given as an argument and checks if each integer is even. If it is, the function appends that integer to the `even_ints` list.
Once all the even integers have been found and added to the `even_ints` list, the function returns the `even_ints` list.
