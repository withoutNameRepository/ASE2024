 ```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the even integers
    even_ints = []
    # Iterate through the list and append even integers to the 'even_ints' list
    for i in range(75, 89):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            even_ints.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the 'even_ints' list
    return even_ints
```
This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a single argument, a list of integers. The function then iterates through the specified range of indices in the input list and appends all even integers to an empty list called `even_ints`. Finally, the function returns the `even_ints` list.
Here is an example usage of this code:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list)
[2, 4, 6, 8]
```
