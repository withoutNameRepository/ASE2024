This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 8 to index 9, both inclusive. The function first initializes an empty list to store the even integers. Then it loops through the list of integers from index 8 to index 9, both inclusive, using the `range()` function. For each integer in the specified range, if the current integer is even, the function adds it to the list of even integers. Finally, the function returns the list of all even integers from index 8 to index 9, both inclusive.
