 Here is a possible implementation of the given function:
```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
	# Initialize an empty list to store the divisible integers
	divisible_integers = []
	# Iterate through the specified range of indices in the input list
	for i in range(36, 85 + 1):
		# Check if the current integer is divisible by both -27 and -96
		if my_list[i] % (-27) == 0 and my_list[i] % (-96) == 0:
			# If it is, add it to the list of divisible integers
			divisible_integers.append(my_list[i])
	# Return the list of all integers divisible by both -27 and -96 from index 36 to index 85, both inclusive
	return divisible_integers
```
This function first initializes an empty list called `divisible_integers` to store the integers that are divisible by both `-27` and `-96`.
Then it iterates through the specified range of indices in the input list using a for loop. For each integer in this range, the function checks if it is divisible by both `-27` and `-96`. If it is, then the integer is added to the `divisible_integers` list.
Finally, the function returns the `divisible_integers` list. If no such integers exist in the specified range, then the function will return an empty list.
