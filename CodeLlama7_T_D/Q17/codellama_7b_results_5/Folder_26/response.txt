 Here's a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the divisible integers
    divisible_integers = []

    # Loop through the input list and check if each integer is divisible by both 72 and 70
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % 72 == 0 and my_list[i] % 70 == 0:
            # If the integer is divisible by both 72 and 70, add it to the list of divisible integers
            divisible_integers.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the list of all integers divisible by both 72 and 70 from index 69 to index 70, both inclusive
    return divisible_integers
```
