 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Check if the specified range contains any integers divisible by both -37 and -26
    for i in range(68, 100 + 1):
        if my_list[i] % (-37) == 0 and my_list[i] % (-26) == 0:
            # If the current element is divisible by both -37 and -26, add it to the result list
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
This function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the specified range of integers in the input list. For each integer in the range, the function checks if it is divisible by both `-37` and `-26`. If the current element is divisible by both numbers, the function adds it to an empty list called `result`, which will contain all the integers divisible by both `-37` and `-26` from index 68 to index 99, both inclusive. Finally, the function returns the `result` list.
