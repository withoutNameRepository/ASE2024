 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % (-6) == 0 and my_list[i] % 4 == 0:
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
This function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. The function then iterates over the elements in `my_list` and checks if each element is divisible by both -6 and 4. If an element is found to be divisible by both, it is added to the `result` list. Finally, the `result` list is returned as the output of the function.
