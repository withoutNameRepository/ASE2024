This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function then loops through the specified range of indices in the input list and checks if each integer is divisible by both 67 and 15. If an integer is found to be divisible by both numbers, it is added to a new list called `result`. The final output of the function is the `result` list containing all the integers that are divisible by both 67 and 15 from index 46 to index 91, inclusive.
