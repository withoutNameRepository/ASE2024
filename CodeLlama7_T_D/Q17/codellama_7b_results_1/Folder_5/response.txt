 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function in Python:
```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % -6 == 0 and my_list[i] % 4 == 0:
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of all integers in that list that are divisible by both -6 and 4. The function first initializes an empty list called `result`. Then, it iterates over the elements of the input list using a for loop, and checks if each element is divisible by both -6 and 4 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the element is divisible by both, the function appends that element to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list.
