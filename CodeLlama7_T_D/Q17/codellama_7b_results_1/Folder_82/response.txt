 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function in Python:
```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the divisible integers
    divisible_integers = []

    # Iterate over the specified range of indices in the input list
    for i in range(20, 201):
        # Check if the current integer is divisible by both -20 and -200
        if my_list[i] % (-20) == 0 and my_list[i] % (-200) == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the list of divisible integers
            divisible_integers.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the list of all integers divisible by both -20 and -200 from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
    return divisible_integers
```
The code is written as a Python function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -20 and -200 from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
