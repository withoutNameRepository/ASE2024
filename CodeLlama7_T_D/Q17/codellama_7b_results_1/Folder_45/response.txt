 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the divisible integers
    divisible_integers = []
    # Loop through the list of integers from index 30 to index 200, both inclusive
    for i in range(30, 201):
        # Check if the current integer is divisible by both -115 and 115
        if my_list[i] % (-115) == 0 and my_list[i] % (115) == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the list of divisible integers
            divisible_integers.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the list of all integers divisible by both -115 and 115 from index 30 to index 200, both inclusive
    return divisible_integers
```
