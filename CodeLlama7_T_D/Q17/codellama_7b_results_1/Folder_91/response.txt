 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function in Python:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the divisible integers
    divisible_integers = []
    # Loop through the list of integers and check if each integer is divisible by both 8 and -3
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % 8 == 0 and my_list[i] % (-3) == 0:
            # If the current integer is divisible by both 8 and -3, append it to the list of divisible integers
            divisible_integers.append(my_list[i])
    return divisible_integers
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is a list of integers. It then iterates through each integer in the specified range and checks if it is divisible by both 8 and -3 using the modulo operator (`%`). If an integer is found to be divisible by both 8 and -3, it is appended to a separate list `divisible_integers`. Finally, the function returns the `divisible_integers` list.
