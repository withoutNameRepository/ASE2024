 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function in Python:
```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    results = []

    # Loop through the specified range of indices
    for i in range(22, 25):

        # Check if the current element is divisible by both -85 and -30
        if my_list[i] % (-85 * -30) == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the results list
            results.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the results list
    return results
```
This function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. It then loops through the specified range of indices (from index 22 to index 24, both inclusive) and checks if each element is divisible by both -85 and -30. If it is, the function adds the element to an empty list called `results`. Finally, the function returns the `results` list.
Note that this function assumes that the specified range of indices contains at least one element that is divisible by both -85 and -30. If there are no such elements in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.
