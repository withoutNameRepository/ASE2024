 Here is a Python function that meets the specification you provided:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Create an empty list to store the divisible integers
    divisible_ints = []

    # Iterate through the specified range of the input list
    for i in range(10, 29):
        # Check if the current integer is divisible by both -61 and -64
        if my_list[i] % -61 == 0 and my_list[i] % -64 == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the list of divisible integers
            divisible_ints.append(my_list[i])
    # Return the list of all integers divisible by both -61 and -64 from index 10 to index 28, both inclusive.
    return divisible_ints
```
This function takes one argument: a list of integers. It returns the list of all integers divisible by both -61 and -64 from index 10 to index 28, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
