This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as input. The function returns a list containing all the integers in the specified range that are divisible by both 6 and 1. If no such integers exist, the function returns an empty list.
The code uses a for loop to iterate through the list of integers and checks if each integer is divisible by both 6 and 1 using the modulo operator. If the current integer is divisible by both 6 and 1, it is added to the result list. The result list is then returned as the output of the function.
#To test the function with a sample input, the code prints the result of calling the function with an input list containing the integers from 1 to 9.
