This code checks each integer in the specified range (index 68 to index 99, both inclusive) for divisibility by -37 and -26. If an integer is divisible by both of these numbers, its index is appended to a list called `divisible_indices`. Finally, the function returns `divisible_indices` as a list of all integers in the specified range that are divisible by both -37 and -26.
