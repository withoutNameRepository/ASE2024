This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all integers in the specified range that are divisible by both 56 and 68. The function first initializes an empty list to store the result and then iterates through the specified range of indices in the input list using a for loop. For each element in the specified range, the function checks if it is divisible by both 56 and 68 using the modulo operator. If the current element is divisible by both 56 and 68, the function adds it to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.
The sample input for this code is a list of integers containing all numbers from 1 to 9. The output of this code should be the list of all integers in the specified range that are divisible by both 56 and 68, which in this case is an empty list because there are no integers in the specified range that are divisible by both 56 and 68.
