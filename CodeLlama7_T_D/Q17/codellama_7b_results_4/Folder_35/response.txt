 Here is a possible implementation of the `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` function in Python:
```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the divisible integers
    divisible_integers = []

    # Iterate over the specified range of the input list
    for i in range(77, 87 + 1):
        # Check if the current element is divisible by both 23 and 57
        if my_list[i] % 23 == 0 and my_list[i] % 57 == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the list of divisible integers
            divisible_integers.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the list of all integers divisible by both 23 and 57 from index 77 to index 87, both inclusive
    return divisible_integers
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is a Python list. If the input is a string or any other type of object, it will not work as expected.
