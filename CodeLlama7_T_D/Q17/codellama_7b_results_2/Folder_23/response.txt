 Here is a possible implementation of the function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` in Python:
```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []

    # Iterate over the specified range of indices
    for i in range(69, 97 + 1):
        # Check if the current integer is divisible by both -90 and -67
        if my_list[i] % (-90 * -67) == 0:
            # If it is, add it to the result list
            result.append(my_list[i])

    # Return the result list
    return result
```
This function takes a single argument `my_list`, which should be a list of integers. It then iterates over the specified range of indices in `my_list` (69 to 97, both inclusive), and checks if each integer is divisible by both -90 and -67. If an integer is divisible by both, it is added to the result list, which is initialized as an empty list at the beginning of the function. Finally, the function returns the result list.
