def find_original_set(s1, s2, s3, s4, s5, s6):
    # create a new set that contains all the given sets
    original_set = s1 | s2 | s3 | s4 | s5 | s6

```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes exactly 7 distinct arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.
