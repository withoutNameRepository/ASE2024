 ```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize the smallest set as the first set in the input list
    smallest_set = sets[0]

    # Loop through each set in the input list and compare it to the current smallest set
    for set in sets:

        # If the current set is smaller than the current smallest set, update the smallest set accordingly
        if len(set) < len(smallest_set):
            smallest_set = set

    # Return the smallest set found
    return smallest_set

```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes a list of sets as input. The function iterates through each set in the input list and checks if it is smaller than the current smallest set found so far. If the current set is smaller, the function updates the smallest set accordingly. Once all sets have been processed, the function returns the smallest set found.
