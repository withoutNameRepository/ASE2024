 ```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize the smallest set with the first set in the input list
    smallest_set = sets[0]
    # Iterate over each set in the input list
    for set in sets:
        # If the current set is smaller than the smallest set, update the smallest set
        if len(set) < len(smallest_set):
            smallest_set = set

    return smallest_set
```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes a list of sets as input. The function iterates over each set in the input list and updates the smallest set with each iteration. The final value of `smallest_set` is returned by the function as the output.
