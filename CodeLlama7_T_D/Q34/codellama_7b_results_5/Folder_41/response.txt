def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize the smallest set to the first set in the input list
    smallest_set = sets[0]

    # Loop through each set in the input list and compare it to the current smallest set

    for i in range(1, len(sets)):
        if len(sets[i]) < len(smallest_set):

    return smallest_set

```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes in a list of sets as an argument. The function first initializes the smallest set to the first set in the input list. Then, it loops through each set in the input list and compares it to the current smallest set. If the length of the current set is less than the length of the smallest set found so far, the function updates the smallest set to be the current set. Finally, the function returns the smallest set found.
