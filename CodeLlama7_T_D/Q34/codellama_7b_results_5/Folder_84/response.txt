 Here's a possible implementation of the `find_original_set` function in Python:
```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the smallest set
    smallest_set = set()

    for arg in sets:
        # Add each element in the argument to the smallest set
        for element in arg:
            smallest_set.add(element)

    return smallest_set
```
This function takes a list of `sets` as input, and returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. The function works by iterating over each argument in the `sets` list, and adding each element in the argument to an empty set called `smallest_set`. Once all elements from each argument have been added to `smallest_set`, the function returns the smallest set.
