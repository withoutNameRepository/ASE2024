def find_original_set(sets):
    # Check if all sets are distinct and have the same size
    if len(set(map(frozenset, sets))) < len(sets) or not all(len(s) == len(sets[0]) for s in sets)):
        raise ValueError("All sets must be distinct and have the same size")

    # Find the smallest set that contains all other sets
    return min(sets, key=lambda x: x.issubset(frozenset(x)))
```
This code uses the `map` function to convert each element in the `sets` list into a frozenset, which allows for easier comparison of subsets. The `key` argument of the `min` function is used to specify that the smallest set should be selected based on its ability to contain all other sets.
