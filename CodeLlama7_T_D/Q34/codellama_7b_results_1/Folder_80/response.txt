 Here's the Python code for the `find_original_set` function:
```python
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Find the smallest set that contains all the given sets
    smallest = None
    for s in sets:
        if smallest is None or len(smallest) > len(s):
            smallest = s

    return smallest
```
This code takes a list of sets as input, and returns the smallest set that contains all the given sets. The `smallest` variable is initialized to `None`, which indicates that no set has been found yet. For each set in the input list, the code checks if it is smaller than the current `smallest` value. If so, the `smallest` variable is updated to reflect this. Once all sets have been processed, the `find_original_set` function returns the smallest set that contains all the given sets.
