This code will find the smallest set that contains all of the given sets. It does this by first checking if all sets are distinct and have the same size, and then sorting the sets in descending order by their size. The smallest set is initialized as the first set in the list, and then iterates over the remaining sets, finding the smallest set that contains all of them using the `issubset` method and the `intersection` method. If any two sets are not compatible, an error is raised.
