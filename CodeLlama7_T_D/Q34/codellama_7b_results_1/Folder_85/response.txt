 ```
def find_original_set(sets):
# Create an empty set as the starting point for our search
smallest = set()

# Iterate over each of the given sets and add their elements to the smallest set we have found so far
for s in sets:
smallest |= s
return smallest
```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes a list of sets as input. It then iterates over each of the given sets and adds their elements to an initially empty set, which becomes our "smallest" set. The function returns this final smallest set.
