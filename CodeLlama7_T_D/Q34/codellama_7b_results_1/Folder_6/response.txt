 Here's the function:
```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Create an empty set to store the smallest set
    smallest_set = set()

    # Iterate through each set in the input list
    for i, s in enumerate(sets):
        # If this is the first set being processed
        if i == 0:
            # Initialize the smallest set with the current set
            smallest_set = s

        # If the current set is not a subset of the smallest set yet
        elif not s <= smallest_set:
            # Update the smallest set to be a subset of the current set
            smallest_set = smallest_set & s

    # Return the smallest set found
    return smallest_set
```
