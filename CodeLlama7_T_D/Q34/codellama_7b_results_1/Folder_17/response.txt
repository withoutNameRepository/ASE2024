 ```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize the smallest set with the first element
    smallest_set = sets[0]
    # Loop through each of the given arguments
    for set in sets:
        # If the current set is smaller than the smallest set, update the smallest set
        if len(set) < len(smallest_set):
            smallest_set = set

    return smallest_set
```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes a list of sets as input. The function returns the smallest set from the given list such that each of the given sets is a subset of it.
