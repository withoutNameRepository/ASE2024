 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_original_set` function in Python:
```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Create a new set that initially contains all elements from the given sets
    original_set = set()
    for s in sets:
        original_set |= s

    # Remove any duplicates from the original set
    original_set = set(original_set)

    # Return the smallest set that includes all elements from the given sets
    return original_set
```
This function takes a list of sets as input, and returns the smallest set that contains all the elements from the given sets. The function first creates an empty set called `original_set` that initially contains all elements from the given sets. It then removes any duplicates from this set using the `set(original_set)` constructor. Finally, it returns the `original_set`.
For example, if we have three sets `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` containing integers 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we can use the following code to find the smallest set that includes all elements from these sets:
```
# Create a list of sets containing integers 1, 2, and 3
sets = [set([1]), set([2]), set([3])]
# Call the 'find_original_set' function with this list of sets as input
result = find_original_set(sets)
#print(result) # Output: {1, 2, 3}
```
In this example, we create a list of sets containing integers 1, 2, and 3 respectively. We then call the `find_original_set` function with this list of sets as input. The output is the smallest set that includes all elements from these sets, which in this case is `{1, 2, 3}`.
