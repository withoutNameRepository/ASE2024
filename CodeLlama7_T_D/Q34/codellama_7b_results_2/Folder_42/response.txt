This function takes a list of sets as input and returns the smallest set that contains all the given sets. The function first initializes the smallest set as the first element in the input list, then iterates over each set in the input list and compares it with the current smallest set. If any of the given sets is not a subset of the current smallest set, the function calculates the union of the current smallest set and the given set and updates the smallest set as the result of the union calculation. The function repeats this process until all the given sets are contained in the smallest set.
