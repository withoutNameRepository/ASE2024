 ```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize the smallest set as the first set in the input
    smallest_set = sets[0]
    # Iterate over each set in the input
    for set in sets:
        # If the current set is smaller than the smallest set, update the smallest set
        if len(set) < len(smallest_set):
            smallest_set = set

    return smallest_set
```
This code defines a function `find_original_set` that takes a single argument of type `list` containing sets of integers. The function returns the smallest set from the input list such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.
The implementation of the function uses a loop to iterate over each set in the input list. For each set, the function checks if it is smaller than the current smallest set, and updates the smallest set accordingly. The function returns the smallest set at the end of the iteration.
