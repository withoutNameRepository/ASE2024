def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize the smallest set as the first set in the input
    smallest_set = sets[0]
    # Iterate over each set in the input
    for i in range(1, len(sets)):
        # If the current set is smaller than the smallest set, update the smallest set
        if len(sets[i]) < len(smallest_set):

    return smallest_set
```
This function takes a list of sets as input and returns the smallest set among them. The function iterates over each set in the input, comparing its size to that of the current smallest set. If a smaller set is found, it becomes the new smallest set. Finally, the function returns the smallest set found in the input.
