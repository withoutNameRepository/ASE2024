 ```
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize the smallest set as the first element in the list of sets
    smallest_set = sets[0]

    # Loop through each set in the list and compare it to the smallest set

    for set in sets:

        # If the current set is smaller than the smallest set, update the smallest set

        if len(set) < len(smallest_set):
            smallest_set = set

    # Return the smallest set

    return smallest_set
```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes a list of sets as input. The function returns the smallest set in the list, which is the original set that all other sets are subsets of.
