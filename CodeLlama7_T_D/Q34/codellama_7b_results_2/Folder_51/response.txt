def find_original_set(sets):
    # initialize the smallest set as the first set in the input
    smallest_set = sets[0]
    # loop through each set in the input and compare it to the smallest set found so far
    for set in sets:
        # if the current set is smaller than the smallest set found so far, update the smallest set

    return smallest_set
```
This code defines a function `find_original_set` that takes a list of sets as input. The function returns the smallest set among all the given sets.
The function first initializes the smallest set to be the first set in the input list. Then, it loops through each set in the input and compares it to the smallest set found so far. If the current set is smaller than the smallest set found so far, the function updates the smallest set to be the current set.
After looping through all the sets in the input, the function returns the smallest set found among all the given sets.
