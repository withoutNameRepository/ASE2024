def find_original_set(sets):
return min(sets, key=lambda x: len(x))
```
This function takes a list of sets as input and returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. The function uses the `min` function to find the smallest set in the list, and the `key` parameter to specify that the length of the set should be used as the key for comparison.
