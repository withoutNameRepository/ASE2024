def find_original_set(sets):
return min(sets, key=len)
```
Explanation:
The `find_original_set` function takes a list of sets as an argument and returns the smallest set that contains all the given sets. The function uses the `min` function with the `key` parameter set to `len`, which returns the element with the minimum length. This ensures that the returned set contains all the elements from the given sets.
