This code defines a function `find_original_set` that takes as input a list of sets and returns the smallest set such that each of the given sets is a subset of it.
The function first gets the list of all elements in the given sets using the `set.union()` method. This allows us to iterate over all possible subsets of the given sets using a nested loop.
Inside the nested loop, we check if the current subset is a subset of each of the given sets using the `<=` operator. If it is not, we skip to the next iteration of the outer loop.
Once we have found the smallest set that satisfies our criteria, we return it.
Note that this code assumes that all of the input sets are non-empty and that they contain only integers. If any of these assumptions do not hold true, then the code may produce incorrect results.
