 Here is a possible implementation of the `find_original_set` function in Python:
```python
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Create a new set with all the elements from the given sets
    original_set = set()
    for s in sets:
        original_set |= s

    # Return the smallest set that contains all the elements from the given sets
    return min(original_set, key=len)
```
This function takes a list of sets as an input and returns the smallest set that contains all the elements from the given sets. The function first creates a new set with all the elements from the given sets using the `|=` operator. Then it uses the `min` function with the `key=len` argument to find the smallest set in the list of sets.
For example, if we call the `find_original_set` function with the following list of sets:
```python
sets = [set([1, 2, 3]), set([4, 5, 6])]
```
The function will return the smallest set that contains all the elements from the given sets, which is `set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])`.
