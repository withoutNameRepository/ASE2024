 Here's a possible implementation of the `find_original_set` function:
```python
def find_original_set(sets):
    # Initialize an empty set to store the smallest subset
    smallest = set()

    for s in sets:
        # For each set, add all its elements to the smallest set
        smallest |= s

    return smallest
```
This function takes a list of sets as input. It then iterates over the sets and adds all their elements to a new set called `smallest`. The resulting set is returned by the function.
For example, if we call the function with the following argument:
`sets = [set([1]), set([2]), set([3])]`
The function would return the smallest set possible that contains all the elements of each of the given sets. In this case, the resulting set would be `set([1, 2, 3])`.
