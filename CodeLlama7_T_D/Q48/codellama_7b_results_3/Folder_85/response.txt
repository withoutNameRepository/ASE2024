 Here is a possible implementation of the function:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 that are not present in the tuple between indices 1 and 8
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, len(tuple)):
        if tuple[i] not in tuple[1:8]:
            sum += tuple[i]
    # If the sum is an odd number, return its binary representation string; otherwise, return its hexadecimal representation string
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        return bin(sum)[2:]

    else:

        return hex(sum)[2:]
```
