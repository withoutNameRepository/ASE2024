 Here is a possible implementation of the function:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 that are not present in the tuple between indices 6 and 9
    a = my_tuple[6]
    b = my_tuple[9]
    sum = 0
    for i in range(a + 1, b):
        if i not in my_tuple:
            sum += i

    # return the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        return bin(sum)[2:]

    else:
        return hex(sum)[2:]
```
