Explanation:
The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers as input. Let `a` and `b` be the two integers in the middle of the range (i.e., between indices 29 and 53). The function calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices 29 and 53.
If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
The letters in the hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.
