 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Check if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple
    present = True
    for i in range(len(tuple)):
        if tuple[i] not in range(tuple[13] + 1, tuple[76] - 1):
            present = False
            break

    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 13 and 76
    if present:
        return ""

    else:

        sum = 0

        for i in range(len(tuple)):
            if tuple[i] not in range(tuple[13] + 1, tuple[76] - 1):
                sum += tuple[i]

        # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum
        if sum % 2 == 0:
            return "{:x}".format(sum)

        else:

            return "{:b}".format(sum)
```
This code first checks if all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple. If all integers are present, then the function returns an empty string. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all integers that are not present in the tuple between indices 13 and 76, and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
