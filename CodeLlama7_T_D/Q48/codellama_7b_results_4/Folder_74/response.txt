This code defines a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function then uses the values of indices 69 and 97 to determine the range of integers between them.
The function then iterates over this range of integers using a for loop, checking if each integer is present in the tuple between indices 69 and 97. If it is not present, the function adds its value to the sum variable.
Once the for loop is complete, the function checks if the sum is an odd number. If it is, the function returns the binary representation of the sum as a string without any leading zeros. If the sum is even, the function returns the hexadecimal representation of the sum as a string without any leading zeros.
Finally, the function returns an empty string if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple.
