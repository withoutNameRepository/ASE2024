 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple_):
    # Get the indices of the range of interest
    start = tuple_.index(tuple_[68]) + 1
    end = tuple_.index(tuple_[99])
    # Calculate the sum of all integers in the range that are not present in the tuple
    sum = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if tuple_[i] not in tuple_[68:99]:
            sum += tuple_[i]
    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return f"{sum:x}"
    else:
        return f"{sum:b}"
```
This implementation uses the `index` method to find the indices of the range of interest in the tuple. It then calculates the sum of all integers in this range that are not present in the specified range in the tuple, using a loop that iterates over the elements of the tuple within this range. Finally, it returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum, depending on whether the sum is an even number or not.
