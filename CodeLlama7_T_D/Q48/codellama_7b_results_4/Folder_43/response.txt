 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Check if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 are present in the specified range in the tuple
    if all(x in my_tuple for x in range(my_tuple[10] + 1, my_tuple[28] - 1)):
        return ""
    else:

        # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 28

        sum = 0
        for x in range(my_tuple[10] + 1, my_tuple[28] - 1):
            if x not in my_tuple:
                sum += x

        # Return the binary representation string of the sum if it is an odd number; otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.

        if sum % 2 == 1:
            return f"{sum:#b}"

        else:

            return f"{sum:#x}"
```
