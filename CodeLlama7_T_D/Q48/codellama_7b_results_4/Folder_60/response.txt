 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Initialize variables
    sum = 0
    odd = False
    binary = ''
    hexa = ''

    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 38 and 52.
    for i in range(tuple[38], tuple[52]):
        if i not in tuple:
            sum = sum + i

    # Check if the sum is an odd number and set the appropriate variable accordingly.
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        odd = True

    # Convert the sum to binary or hexadecimal representation, depending on whether it is an odd number or not.
    if odd == True:
        for i in range(sum):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                binary = binary + '1'
            else:
                binary = binary + '0'

    else:
        hexa = hex(sum)

    # Return the appropriate representation string, depending on whether the sum is an odd number or not.
    if odd == True:
        return binary[2:]
    else:
        return hexa[2:]
```
