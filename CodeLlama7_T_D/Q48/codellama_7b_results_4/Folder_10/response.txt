 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Get the indices of the tuple
    idx36 = tuple.index(36)
    idx54 = tuple.index(54)
    # Get the integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 36 and 54
    missing_ints = [i for i in range(tuple[idx36] + 1, tuple[idx54] - 1)]
    # Filter out any integers that are present in the specified range in the tuple
    filtered_ints = [i for i in missing_ints if i not in tuple[idx36:idx54]]
    # Calculate the sum of all remaining integers
    sum = sum(filtered_ints)
    # Check if the sum is an odd number
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        # Return the binary representation string of the sum
        return bin(sum)[2:]
    else:
        # Return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum
        return hex(sum)[2:]
```
This code assumes that the tuple passed to the function is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The code first gets the indices of the tuple corresponding to 36 and 54, respectively. Then, it calculates the integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 36 and 54 using a list comprehension. Finally, the code filters out any integers that are present in the specified range in the tuple and calculates the sum of all remaining integers using another list comprehension. The code then checks if the sum is an odd number and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum accordingly.
