 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Initialize variables for storing the sum and its binary or hexadecimal representation
    sum = 0
    binary_representation = ''
    hexadecimal_representation = ''

    # Iterate over the integers in the specified range (a + 1 to b - 1)
    for i in range(my_tuple[0] + 1, my_tuple[5] - 1):
        # Check if the current integer is present in the tuple between indices 0 and 5
        if i in my_tuple:
            # If it is present, add its value to the sum
            sum += i

    # Check if the sum is an odd number
    if sum % 2 != 0:
        # If it is an odd number, return its binary representation string
        binary_representation = bin(sum)[2:]
        return binary_representation

    else:
        # If it is an even number, return its hexadecimal representation string
        hexadecimal_representation = hex(sum)[2:]
        return hexadecimal_representation
```
This code uses the `bin()` and `hex()` functions to convert the sum to a binary or hexadecimal representation string. The resulting strings are then returned by the function, along with an empty string if all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple.
