 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple_of_integers):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 29 and 53.
    sum = 0
    for i in range(29, 54):
        if tuple_of_integers[i] not in range(tuple_of_integers[29] + 1, tuple_of_integers[53] - 1)):
            sum += tuple_of_integers[i]
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return "0x" + hex(sum)[2:]
    else:
        return "0b" + bin(sum)[3:]
```
