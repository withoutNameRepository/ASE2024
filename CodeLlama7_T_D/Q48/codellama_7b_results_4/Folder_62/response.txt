 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 50 and 92.
    sum = 0
    for i in range(50, 93):
        if my_tuple[i] == 0:
            sum += i - 49
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if sum % 2 != 0:
        return f"{sum:#b}"
    else:
        return f"{sum:#x}"
```
The function takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `50` and `92`. If the sum is an odd number, it returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
