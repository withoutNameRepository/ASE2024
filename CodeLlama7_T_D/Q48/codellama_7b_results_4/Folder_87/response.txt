 ```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    a = tuple[20]
    b = tuple[43]
    sum = 0
    for i in range(a + 1, b - 1):
        if i not in tuple[20:43]:
            sum += i

    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return hex(sum)[2:]

    else:

        return bin(sum)[3:]
```
Note that the function takes a tuple as input, and returns a string (either binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum). The function also uses some advanced Python concepts such as list slicing, conditional statements, and functions.
