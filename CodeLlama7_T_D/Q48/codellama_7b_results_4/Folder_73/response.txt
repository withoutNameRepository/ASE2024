 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Get the indices of the integers a and b
    index10 = tuple.index(a)
    index76 = tuple.index(b)
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 76
    sum = 0
    for i in range(index10 + 1, index76):
        if tuple[i] not in tuple[index10 + 1:index76]:
            sum += tuple[i]
    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return f"{sum:#0x}"
    else:
        return f"{sum:#0b}"
```
This implementation uses the `index` method to get the indices of the integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `10` and `76`. Finally, it returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
Note that this implementation assumes that the input tuple is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. If the input tuple does not meet these assumptions, the behavior of the function may be undefined.
