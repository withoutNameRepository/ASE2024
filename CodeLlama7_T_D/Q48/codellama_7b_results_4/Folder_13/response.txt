 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Check if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple
    if all(x in range(tuple[46], tuple[91]) for x in tuple):
        return ""

    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 46 and 91
    else:
        sum = 0

        for i in range(tuple[46] + 1, tuple[91]):
            if i not in tuple:
                sum += i

        # Return binary representation string of the sum if it is an odd number; otherwise, return hexadecimal representation string of the sum
        if sum % 2 == 1:
            return bin(sum)[2:]

        else:

            return hex(sum)[2:]
```
