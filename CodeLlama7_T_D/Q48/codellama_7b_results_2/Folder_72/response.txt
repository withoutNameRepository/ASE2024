 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 13 and 70.
    a = my_tuple[13]
    b = my_tuple[70]
    sum = 0
    for i in range(a + 1, b):
        if i not in my_tuple:
            sum += i
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return hex(sum)
    else:
        return bin(sum)
```
This implementation first calculates the sum of all integers from `a` + 1 to `b` - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 13 and 70. It then checks whether the sum is an odd number. If it is, it returns the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
