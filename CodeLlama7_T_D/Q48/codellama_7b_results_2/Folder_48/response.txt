This code takes a tuple as input and returns a binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 933 and 996. The function first calculates the sum of all such integers, then checks if it is an odd number. If it is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
