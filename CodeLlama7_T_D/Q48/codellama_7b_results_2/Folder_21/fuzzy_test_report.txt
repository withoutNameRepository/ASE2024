Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 21, 25, 28, 33, 34, 42, 43, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71, 72, 74, 76, 77, 78, 80, 81, 84, 87, 90, 93, 95, 97, 100, 103, 104, 105, 107, 110, 111, 113, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 129, 134, 135, 137, 139, 141, 142, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 160, 162, 163, 167, 168, 173, 174, 176, 179, 180, 181, 183, 185, 186, 188, 189, 191, 193, 194, 196, 198, 200, 201, 203, 204, 209, 211, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 221]

The correct answer was:
110010110111

But the LLM code returned:
