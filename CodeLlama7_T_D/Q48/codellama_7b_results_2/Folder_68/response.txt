 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
	# Extract the first and last element of the tuple
	a = tuple[0]
	b = tuple[-1]
	# Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 9
	sum = 0
	for i in range(a + 1, b):
		if i not in tuple:
			sum += i
	# Return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum depending on whether it is an odd number or not
	if sum % 2 == 0:
		return f"{hex(sum)[2:]}"
	else:
		return f"{bin(sum)[3:]}".replace("0b", "")
```
