The above code defines a function `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `77` and `84`. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
The code first extracts the values `a` and `b` from the tuple at indices `77` and `84`, respectively. Then, it calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `77` and `84`. The `for` loop iterates over the range of integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1`, and adds each integer that is not present in the tuple to the sum.
After calculating the sum, the code checks if the sum is an odd number. If it is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The `f"{sum:b}"` and `f"{sum:x}"` are string formatting syntax used to convert the integer value of `sum` to a binary or hexadecimal representation string.
Finally, the code returns an empty string if all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple.
