This code defines a function called `return_binary_or_hexa` that takes one argument, a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `55` and `84`. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
In the code, we first calculate the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `55` and `84`. We then check if the sum is an odd number or not. If it is an odd number, we return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, we return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
#In the code, we use a tuple as input to the function. The tuple contains all integers between `0` and `9`, sorted in ascending order. We then call the function with the tuple as its argument. Finally, we print the output of the function to the console.
