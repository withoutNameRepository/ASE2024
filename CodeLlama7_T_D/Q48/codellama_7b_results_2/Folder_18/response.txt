 Here's a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Initialize variables for sum and counter
    sum = 0
    count = 0
    # Iterate over elements in tuple
    for element in tuple:
        # Increment counter and sum if element is not present in range between indices 56 and 90
        if element not in range(tuple[56] + 1, tuple[90] - 1):
            sum += count
            count += 1
    # Return binary or hexadecimal representation of sum
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return "0x" + hex(sum)[2:]
    else:
        return "0b" + bin(sum)[3:]
```
