Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 41, 45, 48, 53, 54, 63, 68, 69, 72, 74, 75, 78, 81, 85, 87, 89, 91, 96, 97, 98, 100, 101, 104, 106, 110, 111, 114, 118, 119, 120, 126, 127, 129, 130, 131, 132, 134, 137, 143, 145, 147, 149, 150, 152, 155, 156, 157, 159, 160, 161, 168, 170, 171, 175, 176, 180, 181, 182, 184, 185, 188, 189, 191, 194, 197, 199, 200, 201, 203, 204, 205, 209, 211, 213, 217, 218, 219, 220, 222, 223, 225, 229, 230, 231, 233, 234, 236, 237]

The correct answer was:
111111011111

But the LLM code returned:
0x91E
