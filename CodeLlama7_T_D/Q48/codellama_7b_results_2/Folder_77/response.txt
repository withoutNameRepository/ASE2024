 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
	# Extract the integers from the tuple between indices 18 and 52
	integers = tuple[18:52]
	# Calculate the sum of all integers not present in the tuple between indices 18 and 52
	sum_of_missing_integers = sum(set(range(tuple[0][18], tuple[0][52])) - set(integers)))
	# If the sum is an odd number, return its binary representation string
	if sum_of_missing_integers % 2 == 1:
		return bin(sum_of_missing_integers)[2:]
	# Otherwise, return its hexadecimal representation string
	else:
		return hex(sum_of_missing_integers)[2:]
```
Note that this function uses the `bin()` and `hex()` built-in functions to convert the sum of missing integers to its binary or hexadecimal representation string.
