 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Check if the tuple is empty or None
    if not my_tuple:
        return ""

    # Get the first and last indices of the tuple
    first_index = 0
    last_index = len(my_tuple) - 1

    # Get the values of a and b from the tuple
    a = my_tuple[40]
    b = my_tuple[200]

    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 that are not present in the tuple between indices 40 and 200
    sum = 0
    for i in range(a + 1, b):
        if i not in my_tuple[first_index:last_index]:
            sum += i

    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return "{:x}".format(sum)
    else:
        return "{:b}".format(sum)
```
This function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers as its only argument. It then checks if the tuple is empty or None, and returns an empty string in this case. If the tuple is not empty or None, it gets the first and last indices of the tuple, and uses these to get the values of `a` and `b` from the tuple. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices `40` and `200`. Finally, it returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum, depending on whether the sum is an odd number.
