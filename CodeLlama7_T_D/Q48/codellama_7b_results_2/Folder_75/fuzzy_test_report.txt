Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 27, 29, 33, 35, 36, 38, 41, 47, 53, 55, 58, 62, 67, 69, 70, 72, 75, 76, 78, 81, 83, 84, 85, 87, 93, 95, 96, 98, 99, 100, 108, 109, 112, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 132, 133, 134, 135, 139, 140, 141, 144, 145, 147, 148, 150, 151, 153, 155, 160, 161, 164, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 174, 176, 177, 181, 182, 183, 184, 186, 189, 191]

The correct answer was:
101010111111

But the LLM code returned:
a5e
