The function takes a single argument `tuple`, which is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum of all integers from `a` + 1 to `b` - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 62 and 96. If all integers from `a` + 1 to `b` - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.
