 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 79
    sum = 0
    for i in range(10, 79):
        if my_tuple[i] != 0:
            sum += i - 9
    # Check if the sum is an odd number
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        return bin(sum)[2:]
    else:
        return hex(sum)[2:]
```
This implementation calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 79. It then checks if the sum is an odd number, and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum accordingly.
