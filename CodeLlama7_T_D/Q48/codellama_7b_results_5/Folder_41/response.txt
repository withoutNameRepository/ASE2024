 Here is a possible implementation of the function `return_binary_or_hexa`:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 3 and 8.
    a = tuple[3]
    b = tuple[8]
    sum_of_integers = 0
    for i in range(a + 1, b):
        if i not in tuple:
            sum_of_integers += i
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if sum_of_integers % 2 == 1:
        return f"{sum_of_integers:b}"
    else:
        return f"{sum_of_integers:x}"
```
