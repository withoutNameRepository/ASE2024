def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # unpack the tuple into a and b
    a, b = my_tuple[10], my_tuple[76]
    # initialize an empty list to store the missing integers
    missing_integers = []
    # loop through all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive)
    for i in range(a + 1, b):
        # if the integer is not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 76
        if i not in my_tuple[10:76]:
            # add it to the list of missing integers
            missing_integers.append(i)
    # calculate the sum of all missing integers
    sum = sum(missing_integers)
    # check if the sum is an odd number
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        # return the binary representation string of the sum
        return bin(sum)[2:]
    else:
        # return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum
        return hex(sum)[2:]

# test the function with a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order
#print(return_binary_or_hexa((1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 48, 64, 96))) # output: '100'
#print(return_binary_or_hexa((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)))) # output: ''
```
Note that this solution uses the `bin()` and `hex()` functions to convert the sum to a binary or hexadecimal string. The `[2:]` syntax is used to remove the prefix "0b" or "0x" from the resulting strings.
