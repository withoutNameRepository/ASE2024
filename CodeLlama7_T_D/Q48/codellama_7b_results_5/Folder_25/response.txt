 ```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Initialize variables for the binary and hexadecimal representations of the sum
    binary_repr = ''
    hexa_repr = ''
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 37 and 43
    for i in range(tuple[37] + 1, tuple[43]):
        if i not in tuple:
            sum += i

    # Check if the sum is an odd number

    if sum % 2 == 1:

        # Return the binary representation string of the sum

        return '{}{}'.format(sum, 'b')

    else:

        # Return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum

        return '{}{}'.format(sum, 'x')

# Test the function with a tuple containing 21 and 43

#print(return_binary_or_hexa((21, 43))

```

This solution works by first calculating the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 37 and 43. It then checks if the sum is an odd number and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum accordingly.

This solution can be improved by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 37 and 43.
