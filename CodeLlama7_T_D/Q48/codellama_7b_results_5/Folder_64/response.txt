 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Initialize variables for the sum and the binary or hexadecimal representation
    sum = 0
    binary = ''
    hexadecimal = ''

    # Iterate over the integers in the tuple, starting from index 1 (i.e., a + 1) to index -1 (i.e., b - 1)
    for i in range(1, len(tuple)):
        # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 5
        if tuple[i] not in tuple[:5]:
            sum += tuple[i]

    # Check whether the sum is an odd number
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        # Convert the sum to its binary representation and return it
        binary = bin(sum)[2:]
        return binary

    else:
        # Convert the sum to its hexadecimal representation and return it
        hexadecimal = hex(sum)[2:]
        return hexadecimal

```
