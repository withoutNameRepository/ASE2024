 ```
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
a = my_tuple[33]
b = my_tuple[78]
sum = 0
for i in range(a + 1, b - 1 + 1):
if i not in my_tuple[33:78 + 1]:
sum += i
if sum % 2 == 1:
return bin(sum)[2:]
else:
return hex(sum)[2:]

```
Note that this code uses the `bin()` and `hex()` functions to convert the sum to binary and hexadecimal representations, respectively. The `[2:]` slices are used to remove the "0b" or "0x" prefixes from the string representations.
