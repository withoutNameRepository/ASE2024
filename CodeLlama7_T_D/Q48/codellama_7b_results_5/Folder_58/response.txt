 Here's a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 275 and 871.
    my_sum = 0
    for i in range(276, 872):
        if i == 275 or i == 871:
            continue

        elif my_tuple[i] != None:
            my_sum += my_tuple[i]

    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if my_sum % 2 == 1:
        return bin(my_sum)[2:]

    else:
        return hex(my_sum)[2:]
```
