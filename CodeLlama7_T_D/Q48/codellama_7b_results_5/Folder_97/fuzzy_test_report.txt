Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 40, 44, 47, 52, 53, 61, 62, 67, 68, 71, 73, 74, 75, 77, 80, 84, 86, 88, 90, 95, 96, 97, 99, 100, 103, 106, 109, 112, 113, 114, 120, 123, 127, 132, 133, 136, 137, 141, 143, 144, 146, 148, 151, 156, 157, 159, 161, 163, 164, 166, 169, 170, 171, 173, 174, 175, 182, 184, 189, 190, 193, 195, 196, 198, 199, 202, 203, 205, 206, 208, 209, 210, 211, 213, 218, 221, 223, 224, 225, 226, 230, 232, 233, 234, 235, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 244, 246, 255, 256, 258, 259, 260, 262, 264, 265]

The correct answer was:
1010001111101

But the LLM code returned:
0b1010001111101
