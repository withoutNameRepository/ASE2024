Explanation:
The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input. The function calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 4. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
Example:
Input: (0, 1, 2, 4, 5)
Output: '0x6' or '0b110'
Explanation:
The sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 4 is 3. Since 3 is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of 3 which is '0b1'.
In the example input, the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 0 and 4 is 6. Since 6 is an even number, the function returns the hexadecimal representation string of 6 which is '0x6'.
