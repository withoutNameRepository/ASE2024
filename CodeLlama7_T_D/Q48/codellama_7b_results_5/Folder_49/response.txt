 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 80 and 200.
    sum = 0
    for i in range(80, 200 + 1):
        if tuple[i] != tuple[i - 1] + 1:
            sum += tuple[i] - tuple[i - 1] - 1
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        return "0b" + bin(sum)[2:]
    else:
        return "0x" + hex(sum)[2:]
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the tuple passed as an argument is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. If this assumption does not hold, the function may produce incorrect results or throw an exception.
