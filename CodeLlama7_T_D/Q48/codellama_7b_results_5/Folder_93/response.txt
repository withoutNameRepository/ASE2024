 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 57 and 85.
    sum = 0
    for i in range(57, 85 + 1):
        if tuple[i] not in range(a + 1, b - 1 + 1):
            sum += tuple[i]
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return f'{sum:x}'
    else:
        return f'{sum:b}'
```
This implementation first calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices `57` and `85`. It then checks if the sum is an odd number or not. If it is an odd number, it returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
Note that this implementation assumes that the tuple passed to the function is a valid tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. If the tuple is not valid, the function may produce incorrect results or throw an exception.
