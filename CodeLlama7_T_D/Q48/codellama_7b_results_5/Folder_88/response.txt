 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Initialize variables for calculating sum
    sum = 0
    # Calculate sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 3 and 9
    for i in range(tuple[3] + 1, tuple[9] - 1):
        if i not in tuple:
            sum += i

    # Check if sum is an odd number
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        return bin(sum)[2:]

    else:
        return hex(sum)[2:]
```
This function takes a single argument, `tuple`, which is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function then calculates the sum of all integers from the 4th element (index 3) to the 10th element (index 9) that are not present in the specified range between indices 3 and 9, and returns either a binary or hexadecimal representation string of this sum, depending on whether the sum is an odd number or not. If all integers from the 4th element to the 10th element (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.
