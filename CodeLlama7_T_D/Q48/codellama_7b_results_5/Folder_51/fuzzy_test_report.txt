Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 16, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30]

The correct answer was:
1101011

But the LLM code returned:
101011

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 30, 33)
