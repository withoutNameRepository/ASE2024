def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    a = tuple[6]
    b = tuple[9]
    sum = 0
    for i in range(a + 1, b - 1 + 1):
        if i not in tuple[6:9]:
            sum += i

Note that the code uses a variable `tuple` which is a reserved word in Python and should not be used as a variable name. The function takes an argument `tuple` of type `tuple` and returns a string representing the sum of the integers between indices 6 and 9 that are not present in the specified range in the tuple.
