 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Initialize variables for the sum and the binary representation string
    sum = 0
    binary_repr = ""
    # Loop through the integers in the specified range of the tuple
    for i in range(my_tuple[60], my_tuple[90] + 1):
        # Check if the current integer is not present in the tuple between indices 60 and 90
        if i not in my_tuple[60:90]:
            # If the current integer is not present, add it to the sum
            sum += i

    # Check if the sum is an odd number
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        # If the sum is an odd number, return its binary representation string
        for digit in bin(sum)[2:]:
            binary_repr += digit

    else:
        # If the sum is an even number, return its hexadecimal representation string
        for digit in hex(sum)[2:]:
            if digit != "":
                binary_repr += digit

    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum
    return binary_repr
```
This function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as its only argument. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 60 and 90. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
