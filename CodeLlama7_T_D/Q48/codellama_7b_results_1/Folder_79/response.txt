 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Check if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple
    for i in range(1, len(tuple)):
        if tuple[i] - tuple[i-1] != 1:
            return ""

    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 1 and 7

    sum = 0

    for i in range(1, len(tuple)):
        if tuple[i] != tuple[i-1] + 1:
            sum += tuple[i-1] + 1

    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum depending on whether it is an odd number

    if sum % 2 == 1:
        return bin(sum)[2:]

    else:
        return hex(sum)[2:]
```
This code first checks if all integers from `a` to `b` (both inclusive) are present in the tuple between indices 1 and 7. If they are not, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices 1 and 7. It then checks whether the sum is an odd number, and returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum depending on whether it is an odd number.
