Explanation:
The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as input. It then calculates the sum of all integers from the 201st index to the 203rd index (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 200 and 202. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum. Otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros. The letters in hexadecimal representation can be either in lowercase or uppercase. If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function returns an empty string.
