The function takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order as its argument. It stores the integer stored at index 10 as variable 'a' and the integer stored at index 97 as variable 'b'. The function then calculates the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 10 and 97. It uses the "in" operator to check if an integer is present in the specified range in the tuple. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum using the format string ':{:b}'. Otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum using the format string ':{:x}'. The binary and hexadecimal representations are formatted to start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
