 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 30 and 200.
    sum = 0
    for i in range(30, 200):
        if tuple[i] == None:
            sum += i + 1 - tuple[i-1]
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if (sum % 2) == 0:
        return hex(sum)[2:]
    else:
        return bin(sum)[3:]
```
This code uses a combination of for loops and the `hex()` and `bin()` functions to calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 30 and 200. If the sum is an odd number, it returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it should return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
