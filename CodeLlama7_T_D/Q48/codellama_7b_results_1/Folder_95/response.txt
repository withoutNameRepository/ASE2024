 Here is a possible implementation of the function `return_binary_or_hexa` in Python:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Initialize variables
    a = tuple[32]
    b = tuple[99]
    sum = 0

    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 32 and 99
    for i in range(a + 1, b):
        if i not in tuple[32:99]:
            sum += i

    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return f'{sum:x}'
    else:
        return f'{sum:b}'
```
This implementation assumes that the input tuple is a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. It then calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices `32` and `99`. Finally, it returns the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum, depending on whether the sum is an odd number or not.
