The above function takes a tuple as input, which consists of distinct nonnegative integers sorted in ascending order. The function then calculates the sum of all integers from the 78th element to the 85th element (both inclusive) that are not present in the specified range between indices 77 and 84. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary representation should not be prefixed with '0b', and the hexadecimal representation should not be prefixed with '0x'.
