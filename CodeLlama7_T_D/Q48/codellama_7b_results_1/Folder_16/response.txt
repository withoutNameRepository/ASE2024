This Python code implements the logic specified in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of distinct nonnegative integers as input and calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 90 and 97. If the sum is an odd number, it returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
