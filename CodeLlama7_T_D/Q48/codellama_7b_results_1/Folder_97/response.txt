 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function in Python:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 34 and 69
    sum = 0
    for i in range(34, 69 + 1):
        if tuple[i] not in tuple[34:69]:
            sum += tuple[i]
    # If the sum is an odd number, return the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, return the hexadecimal representation string of the sum
    if sum % 2 == 1:
        return bin(sum)[2:]
    else:
        return hex(sum)[2:]
```
This implementation uses a nested loop to iterate over the integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` (both inclusive), and checks if each integer is not present in the tuple between indices `34` and `69`. If an odd number of integers are present, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
