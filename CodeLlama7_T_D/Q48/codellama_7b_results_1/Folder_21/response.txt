 Here is a possible implementation of the function `return_binary_or_hexa`:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Find the indices of the two numbers we want to sum
    a = tuple[15]
    b = tuple[57]
    # Initialize the sum to 0
    sum = 0
    # Iterate through all the integers between a and b
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        # If the integer is not present in the specified range in the tuple, add it to the sum
        if i not in tuple:
            sum += i
    # If the sum is an odd number, return its binary representation string
    if sum % 2 != 0:
        return f"{sum:b}"
    # Otherwise, return its hexadecimal representation string
    else:
        return f"{sum:x}"
```
