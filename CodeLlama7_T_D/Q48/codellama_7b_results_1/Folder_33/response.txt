 Here is a Python implementation of the function:
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
# Get the values at indices 13 and 35
a = tuple[13]
b = tuple[35]
# Initialize an empty list to store the integers between a + 1 and b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple
between_indices = []
# Loop through all the integers between a + 1 and b - 1 (both inclusive)
for i in range(a + 1, b):
# If the integer is not present in the tuple between indices 13 and 35, add it to the list
if i not in tuple[13:35]:
between_indices.append(i)
# Calculate the sum of all integers in the list
sum = 0
for integer in between_indices:
sum += integer
# Return an empty string if all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple
if not sum:
return ''
# If the sum is an odd number, return its binary representation string; otherwise, return its hexadecimal representation string.
elif sum % 2 == 1:
binary_representation = bin(sum)[2:]
hexadecimal_representation = hex(sum)[2:]
return binary_representation if len(binary_representation) > 1 else '0' + binary_representation if len(binary_representation) == 1 else hexadecimal_representation.upper()
# If the sum is an even number, return its binary representation string with no leading zeros; otherwise, return its hexadecimal representation string with no leading zeros.
else:
binary_representation = bin(sum)[3:]
hexadecimal_representation = hex(sum)[2:]
return binary_representation if len(binary_representation) > 1 else '0' + binary_representation if len(binary_representation) == 1 else hexadecimal_representation.upper()
