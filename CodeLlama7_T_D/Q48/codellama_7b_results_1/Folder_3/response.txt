 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(my_tuple):
    # Get the starting and ending indices of the specified range
    start = my_tuple[56] + 1
    end = my_tuple[88] - 1
    # Calculate the sum of all integers in the specified range that are not present in the tuple between indices 56 and 88
    sum = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if i not in my_tuple[56:88]:
            sum += i
    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation of the sum, depending on whether it is an odd number
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return f"{hex(sum)[2:]}"
    else:
        return f"{bin(sum)[3:]}"
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the specified range of integers between indices 56 and 88 in the tuple is sorted in ascending order. If this assumption is not met, the function may produce incorrect results or fail to execute altogether.
