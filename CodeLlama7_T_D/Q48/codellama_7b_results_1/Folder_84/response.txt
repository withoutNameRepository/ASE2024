 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_binary_or_hexa` function:
```
def return_binary_or_hexa(tuple):
    # Calculate the sum of all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) that are not present in the tuple between indices 32 and 44.
    sum = 0
    for i in range(32, 44):
        if tuple[i] not in range(tuple[32] + 1, tuple[44] - 1)):
            sum += tuple[i]
    # Return the binary or hexadecimal representation string of the sum.
    if sum % 2 == 0:
        return "0x" + hex(sum)[2:]
    else:
        return "0b" + bin(sum)[3:]
```
This function takes a tuple as input and calculates the sum of all integers from `a + 1` to `b - 1` that are not present in the tuple between indices `32` and `44`. If the sum is an odd number, the function returns the binary representation string of the sum; otherwise, it returns the hexadecimal representation string of the sum. The binary and hexadecimal representations should start with the most significant digit and have no leading zeros.
