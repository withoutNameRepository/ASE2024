This code defines a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function first finds the first index where the integer is not divisible by -53 using the `next` function with an iterator comprehension. It then finds the last index where the integer is not divisible by -53 using the same iterator comprehension in reverse order. Finally, it returns the list of all integers not divisible by -53 from index 25 to index 76, both exclusive.
