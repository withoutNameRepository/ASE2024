Explanation:
The function takes a list of integers as its argument and returns the list of all integers not divisible by 93 from index 45 to index 72, both exclusive.
The function first creates an empty list called `divisible_indices`. This list will store the indices of the integers in the original list that are not divisible by 93.
Next, the function loops through each integer in the range from index 45 to index 72, both exclusive. For each integer, the function checks if it is divisible by 93 using the modulo operator (`%`). If the integer is not divisible by 93, then the function adds the index of that integer to the `divisible_indices` list.
After looping through all the integers in the range, the function returns the list of all integers not divisible by 93 from index 45 to index 72, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, then the function returns an empty list.
