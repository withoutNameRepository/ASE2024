```
This code will check each integer in the specified range (80 to 200) to see if it is divisible by 1000. If it is not divisible, it will be added to a list of indices where the integer is not divisible by 1000.
Finally, the code will return a list of all integers from the specified range (80 to 200) that are not divisible by 1000. If there are no such integers in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.
