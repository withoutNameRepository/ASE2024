def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    start = 68
    end = 99
    neg_ints = []
    for i in range(start, end + 1):

```
This code defines a function called `all_neg_ints_exclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all negative integers from index 68 to index 99, both exclusive. The function first defines two variables, `start` and `end`, which represent the starting and ending indices of the range of interest. Then, it initializes an empty list called `neg_ints` to store the negative integers that are found in the specified range.
Next, the code uses a for loop to iterate through the range of indices defined by `start` and `end`. For each iteration, the code checks if the element at the current index is less than 0 (i.e., it is a negative integer). If this condition is true, the code appends the element at the current index to the `neg_ints` list.
Finally, the function returns the `neg_ints` list, which contains all of the negative integers that were found in the specified range. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list.
