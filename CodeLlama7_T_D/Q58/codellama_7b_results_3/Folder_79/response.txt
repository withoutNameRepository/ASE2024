 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):
            if matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n].all():
                count += 1

    return count
```
This function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers, and `n`, which is the number of integers that must be present in each submatrix. The function first loops over all possible positions where the submatrix can start (i.e., from the top-left corner of the matrix), and then loops over all possible positions where the submatrix can end (i.e., from the bottom-right corner of the matrix). For each possible position, the function checks if the submatrix starting at that position has `n` integers in it by using the `all()` method of a NumPy array. If the submatrix has `n` integers in it, the function increments a counter variable called `count`.
After checking all possible positions where the submatrix can start and end, the function returns the value of the `count` variable, which will be either 0 if no such submatrix is found, or some non-zero integer if such a submatrix is found.
