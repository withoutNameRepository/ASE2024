This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input. It then iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix using nested for loops, checking each submatrix of size 13x13 to see if it contains only the number 13. If such a submatrix is found, the count variable is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of the count variable.
