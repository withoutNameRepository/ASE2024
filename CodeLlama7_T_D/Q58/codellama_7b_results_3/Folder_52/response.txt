This code defines a function `submatrix_with_n_numbers` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input. The function returns the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 147 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.
The code first initializes the count to 0 and then loops over each row of the matrix using nested for-loops. For each element in the current row, the function checks if the current element is equal to 147. If it is, the function increments the count by 1.
After looping over all elements in the current row, the function moves on to the next row and repeats the process until all rows have been processed. Finally, the function returns the count of submatrices with 147 integers each.
