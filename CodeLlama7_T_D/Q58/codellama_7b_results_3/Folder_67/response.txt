 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
            if matrix[i][j] == n:
                count += 1

    return count
```
This function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is a two-dimensional numpy array of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of integers that each submatrix should contain.
The function first initializes a variable called `count` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the total number of submatrices that meet the criteria specified in the problem statement.
Next, the function loops through each row of the matrix using a nested loop. For each row, it loops through each column and checks if the current element is equal to `n`. If it is, the function increments the `count` variable by 1.
Finally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable, which represents the total number of submatrices that contain 43 integers each.
