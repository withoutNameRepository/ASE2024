 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function in Python:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(A):
    # Initialize count variable
    count = 0

    # Iterate over all possible submatrices of A
    for i in range(len(A)):
        for j in range(i, len(A[0])):
            # Check if the current submatrix has 46 integers
            if sum(A[i][j]) == 46:
                # Increment count variable
                count += 1

    # Return count variable
    return count
```
This implementation first initializes a `count` variable to 0. Then, it iterates over all possible submatrices of the input matrix `A`, using two nested for loops. For each submatrix, the function checks if it has 46 integers by summing up the values in its cells. If such a submatrix is found, the function increments the `count` variable. Finally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable.
