 ```
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(matrix) - 1):
        for j in range(len(matrix[i]) - 1):
            if matrix[i][j] == 4:
                count += 1

    return count

```
Note that this function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input and returns the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 4 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function should return 0.
