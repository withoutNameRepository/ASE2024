 Here's a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    # Initialize the count variable
    count = 0
    
    # Loop over all rows and columns of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):
            # Check if the submatrix has 144 integers
            if sum(matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n]) == 144:
                # Increment the count variable
                count += 1
                
    # Return the count of all submatrices that contain 144 integers each
    return count
```
This function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the size of the submatrix. The function returns the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 144 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.
