 Here's a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):
            if all(matrix[i + k][j + l] == n for k in range(n) for l in range(n)):
                count += 1

    return count
```
This function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers, and `n`, which is the number of integers that each submatrix must contain. The function first initializes a counter variable `count` to 0.
The function then loops over all rows and columns in the input matrix using nested for loops. For each row `i` and column `j`, the function checks if every element in the `n x n` submatrix that starts at position `(i, j)` is equal to the value of `n`. If this condition is true for all elements in the submatrix, the function increments the counter variable `count`.
After completing the nested loops, the function returns the final value of the counter variable `count`, which represents the number of submatrices that contain exactly `n` integers each.
