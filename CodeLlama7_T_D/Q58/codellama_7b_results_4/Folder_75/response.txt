 Here's a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    # Initialize variables
    count = 0
    rows, cols = matrix.shape

    # Loop through each row and column
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Get the current element
            element = matrix[i][j]
            # If the element is not 80, skip to the next iteration
            if element != 80:
                continue

            # Check if the submatrix has exactly 80 integers
            if count_integers(matrix[i:i+2, j:j+2]) == 80:
                count += 1

    return count

# Helper function to count the number of integers in a submatrix
def count_integers(submatrix):
    # Initialize variables
    count = 0
    rows, cols = submatrix.shape

    # Loop through each row and column
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # If the element is not an integer, skip to the next iteration
            if not np.isinteger(submatrix[i][j]):
                continue

            # Increment the count of integers in the submatrix
            count += 1

    return count
```
