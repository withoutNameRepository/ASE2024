```
This code uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible submatrices of the given matrix. For each submatrix, it calculates the sum of all elements in the submatrix using the `sum()` function and compares it to the target value of 40. If the sum is equal to the target value, the code increments a count variable to keep track of the number of submatrices that contain 40 integers each.
Finally, the code returns the count variable as the result of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers()` function.
