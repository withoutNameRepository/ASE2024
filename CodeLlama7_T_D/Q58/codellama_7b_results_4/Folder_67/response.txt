def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    count = 0
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - 3):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - 3):
            if all([x == 43 for x in matrix[i:i+4, j:j+4].ravel()]):
                count += 1

    return count
```
This code uses a nested loop to iterate over the submatrices of the given matrix. The `all()` function is used to check if all elements in each submatrix are equal to 43. If any such submatrix is found, the count is incremented and the process continues until the end of the matrix. Finally, the total count of all submatrices containing 43 integers each is returned.
