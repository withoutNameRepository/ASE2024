 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):
            if all(matrix[i+k, j+l] == n for k in range(n) for l in range(n))):
                count += 1
    return count
```
To test the function, we can create a random matrix and check its submatrices. Here is an example of how to do this:
```
import numpy as np

# Create a random matrix
matrix = np.random.randint(0, 100, size=(10, 10))
# Print the matrix
#print(matrix)

# Check the submatrices
for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
    for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
#        print("Submatrix at", i, j)
        # Get the submatrix
        submatrix = matrix[i:i+3, j:j+3]
        # Print the submatrix
#        print(submatrix)
        # Check if the submatrix has 53 integers
        count = 0
        for k in range(3):
            for l in range(3):
                if submatrix[k, l] == 53:
                    count += 1
#        print("Count:", count)
```
#This code will create a random matrix and check its submatrices. It will also print the count of all submatrices that contain 53 integers each.
