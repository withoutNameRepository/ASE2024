 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    # Initialize a counter for the number of submatrices found
    count = 0

    # Iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):
            # Check if the submatrix has n integers
            if np.count_nonzero(matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n]) == n:
                # Increment the counter if a submatrix with n integers is found
                count += 1

    # Return the number of submatrices found
    return count
```
This function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the number of integers required in each submatrix.
The function iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix using nested loops, and for each row and column, it checks if the submatrix has n integers using the `np.count_nonzero` function. If a submatrix with n integers is found, the counter is incremented by 1. Finally, the function returns the number of submatrices found.
