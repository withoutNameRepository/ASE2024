 ```
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
            if matrix[i][j] == 87:
                count += 1

    return count
```
The above code defines a function `submatrix_with_n_numbers` that takes one argument, which is a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers. The function returns the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 87 integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.
The code first imports the NumPy library as np.

The code then defines a for loop to iterate over the rows of the matrix. Inside the for loop, another for loop is defined to iterate over the columns of the matrix.

Inside the inner for loop, the value at the current row and column (i.e., matrix[i][j]) is checked against the target value 87. If the values match, the count variable is incremented by 1. This indicates that a submatrix containing the target value has been found.

The code then returns the final value of the count variable, which represents the total number of submatrices containing the target value in the original matrix.
