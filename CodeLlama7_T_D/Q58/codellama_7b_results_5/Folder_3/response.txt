 Here's a solution in Python:
```
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # Loop over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Get the current row of the matrix
        row = matrix[i]
        # Check if the current row contains n integers
        if row.size == n:
            count += 1

    return count
```
To test this function, you can use the following code:
```
# Test the submatrix_with_n_numbers function
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
#print(submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, 5))
```
This code should output `0`, since there are no submatrices of the given matrix that contain 5 integers each.
