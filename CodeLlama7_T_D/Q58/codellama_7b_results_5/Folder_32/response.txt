 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    # Initialize a counter for the number of submatrices found
    count = 0

    # Loop over each row in the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Loop over each column in the matrix
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Initialize a counter for the number of integers found in the current submatrix
            subcount = 0

            # Loop over each element in the current submatrix
            for row in range(i, i + 103):
                for col in range(j, j + 103):
                    if matrix[row][col] == 1:
                        # Increment the counter for the number of integers found in the current submatrix
                        subcount += 1

            # Check if the current submatrix contains 103 integers each
            if subcount == 103 * 103:
                # Increment the overall counter for the number of submatrices found
                count += 1

    # Return the number of submatrices containing 103 integers each
    return count
```
This code uses nested loops to iterate over each row and column in the matrix, and checks if a submatrix of size 103x103 contains only the value `1`. If such a submatrix is found, the overall counter for the number of submatrices containing 103 integers each is incremented. The function returns the overall counter at the end.
