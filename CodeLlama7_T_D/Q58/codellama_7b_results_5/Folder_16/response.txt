 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function in Python using NumPy:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(A, n):
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # Iterate over each row and column of A
    for i in range(A.shape[0]):
        for j in range(A.shape[1]):
            # Check if the current element is equal to n
            if A[i, j] == n:
                # If so, increment the count by 1
                count += 1
    # Return the count of all submatrices that contain n integers each
    return count
```
This function takes two arguments: `A`, a two-dimensional NumPy matrix of integers, and `n`, an integer representing the number of integers to check for in each submatrix. The function returns the count of all submatrices of `A` that contain `n` integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.
