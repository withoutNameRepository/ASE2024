 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    # Initialize the count to 0
    count = 0
    # Loop over each row and column in the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Check if the current submatrix contains n integers
            if np.sum(matrix[i:, j]) == n:
                # Increment the count by 1
                count += 1
    # Return the count of all submatrices that contain n integers each
    return count
```
This function takes two arguments: a two-dimensional numpy matrix `matrix` and an integer `n`. It returns the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain `n` integers each. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.
