 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
            if matrix[i][j] == n:
                count += 1

    return count
```
The function takes two arguments: a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers, and an integer `n` representing the number of elements in each submatrix.
It first initializes the `count` variable to 0.
Then it iterates over each row `i` of the input matrix.
For each row `i`, it then iterates over each column `j` within that row.
For each column `j`, it checks if the element at position `(i, j)` in the input matrix is equal to the number `n`. If it is, it increments the `count` variable by 1.
Finally, the function returns the value of the `count` variable.
Here's an example usage of this function:
```python
matrix = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, 2) # Output: 1
submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, 3) # Output: 0
submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, 4) # Output: 1
```
In the first example, we pass a 2x2 numpy matrix with elements `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`. The function returns `1` because there is one submatrix in this matrix that contains 2 integers (`1` and `2`) each.
In the second example, we pass the same matrix as before, but ask for a submatrix with 3 integers each. Since such a submatrix does not exist in this matrix, the function returns `0`.
In the third example, we ask for a submatrix with 4 integers each, which is possible because there is at least one submatrix in this matrix that contains 4 integers (`1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`) each. The function returns `1` to indicate that such a submatrix exists in the input matrix.
