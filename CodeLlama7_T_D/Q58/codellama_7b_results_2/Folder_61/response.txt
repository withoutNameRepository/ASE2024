 Here is a possible implementation of the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function:
```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    # Initialize the count variable
    count = 0
    # Iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # If the current element is equal to 4, increase the count by 1
            if matrix[i][j] == 4:
                count += 1
    # Return the count of all submatrices that contain 4 integers each
    return count
```
This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input. It then iterates over the rows and columns of the matrix, and for each element that is equal to 4, it increases the count variable by 1. Finally, it returns the count of all submatrices that contain 4 integers each.
