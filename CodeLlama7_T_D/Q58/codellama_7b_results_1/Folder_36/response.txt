This code uses the NumPy library to perform matrix operations. The `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function takes a two-dimensional integer numpy array as its argument, and returns the number of submatrices of size 131x131 that contain exactly 131 integers each.
The code first iterates over all rows and columns of the given matrix, and for each row and column, it checks if the sum of all elements in a 131x131 submatrix starting from that row and column is equal to 131 * 131 (i.e., if the submatrix contains exactly 131 integers). If such a submatrix exists, the code increments the count variable by 1.
At the end of the function call, the `submatrix_with_n_numbers` function returns the value of the `count` variable, which is the number of submatrices of size 131x131 that contain exactly 131 integers each.
