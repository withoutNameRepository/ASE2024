```
This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input. It then loops over all possible starting positions in the matrix and checks if the current submatrix has 180 integers. If it does, the counter is incremented by one. Finally, the function returns the total number of submatrices found that contain 180 integers each.
