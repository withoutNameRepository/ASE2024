 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_n_smallest_chars` function:
```python
def return_n_smallest_chars(string, n):
    # Sort the characters in descending order based on their ASCII values
    sorted_chars = sorted(string, key=ord, reverse=True)
    # Return the first 84 characters of the sorted list
    return sorted_chars[:84]
```
This function takes two arguments: a string `string` of distinct characters and an integer `n` representing the number of characters to return. It sorts the characters in the string in descending order based on their ASCII values, using the built-in `sorted` function with the `key` parameter set to `ord`. It then returns the first 84 characters of the sorted list, which corresponds to the top 84 characters in the sorted list.
