 Here is a possible implementation of the `return_n_smallest_chars` function:
```python
def return_n_smallest_chars(s, n):
    # sort the characters in the string s by their ASCII values
    sorted_chars = sorted(s, key=ord)
    # return the first n characters of the sorted list
    return sorted_chars[:n]
```
This function takes two arguments: `s`, a string of distinct characters, and `n`, an integer representing the number of characters to be returned. It returns a list of exactly `n` characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The list is sorted in descending order based on the ASCII values of the characters.
