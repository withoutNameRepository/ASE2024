def return_n_smallest_chars(string, n):
    # Create a list of tuples containing the character and its ASCII value
    char_list = [(char, ord(char)) for char in string]
    # Sort the list in ascending order based on the ASCII value

```
This code defines a function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes two arguments: a string of distinct characters and an integer value representing the number of smallest characters to be returned. The function creates a list of tuples containing the character and its ASCII value for each character in the input string. It then sorts this list in ascending order based on the ASCII value, and returns the first n characters of the sorted list.
