 ```
def return_n_smallest_chars(string):
    # sort the string in descending order based on ASCII values
    sorted_string = sorted(string, key=ord, reverse=True)
    # create a list of exactly 32 characters from the sorted string
    n_smallest_chars = sorted_string[:32]
    return n_smallest_chars
```
This code defines a function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes a single argument, a string of distinct characters. The function sorts the string in descending order based on ASCII values using the built-in `sorted()` function with the `key` and `reverse` parameters set to `ord`, which returns the integer code for each character in the string, and `True`, respectively.
The sorted string is then sliced to extract exactly 32 characters from it, as requested by the problem statement. The resulting list of 32 characters is returned by the function.
