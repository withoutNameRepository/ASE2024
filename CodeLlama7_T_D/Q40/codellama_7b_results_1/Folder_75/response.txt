 ```
def return_n_smallest_chars(my_string):
    # Sort the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values
    sorted_chars = sorted(my_string)
    # Return the first two elements of the sorted list
    return sorted_chars[:2]
```
This function takes a single argument, which is a string of distinct characters. It then sorts the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values using the `sorted` function. Finally, it returns the first two elements of the sorted list using slicing.
