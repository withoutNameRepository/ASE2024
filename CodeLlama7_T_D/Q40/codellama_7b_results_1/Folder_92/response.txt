 ```
def return_n_smallest_chars(string, n):
    # convert the string to a list of characters
    char_list = list(string)
    # sort the list of characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values
    sorted_char_list = sorted(char_list, key=ord)
    # return the first 63 characters of the sorted list
    return sorted_char_list[:n]
```
This code will take a string of distinct characters and return a list of exactly 63 characters of that string that have the smallest ASCII values. The list will be sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values, and the first 63 characters will be returned.
