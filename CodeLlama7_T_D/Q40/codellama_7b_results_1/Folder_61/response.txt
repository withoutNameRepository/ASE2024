```
This function takes two arguments: a string of distinct characters, and an integer indicating the number of smallest ASCII values to be returned. It creates a list of tuples containing the ASCII value and character for each character in the string. It then sorts this list based on the ASCII value in descending order and returns the top n characters from the sorted list.
