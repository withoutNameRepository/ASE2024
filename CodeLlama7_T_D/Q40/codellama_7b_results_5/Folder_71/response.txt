def return_n_smallest_chars(string):
    # sort the characters in the string based on their ASCII values
    sorted_chars = sorted(string, key=ord)
    # create a list of exactly 14 characters from the sorted list

```
This code defines a function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes a single argument, a string of distinct characters. The function first sorts the characters in the string based on their ASCII values using the `sorted` function with the key set to the `ord` function. This sorts the characters in ascending order based on their ASCII values.
Next, the function creates a list of exactly 14 characters from the sorted list using slicing. The slice `[:14]` selects all the elements up to but not including the 15th element.
Finally, the function returns the list of 14 smallest characters in ascending order using the `return` statement.
