 ```
def return_n_smallest_chars(my_string, n):
    # Sort the characters of the string in ascending order based on their ASCII values
    sorted_chars = sorted(my_string, key=ord)
    # Return the first n elements of the sorted list
    return sorted_chars[:n]
```
This code defines a function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes two arguments: a string `my_string` of distinct characters and an integer `n`. The function sorts the characters of the string in ascending order based on their ASCII values, and returns the first `n` elements of the sorted list.
For example, if we call the function with the following inputs:
* `my_string = "Hello World"` (a string of distinct characters)
* `n = 73` (the number of characters to return)
The output would be a list of exactly 73 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The list would be sorted in ascending order, and it would look something like this:
```
['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'W', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd']
```
Note that the list contains only the characters from the original string, and it does not contain any duplicates.
