This function takes two arguments: a string of distinct characters, and an integer `n` that represents the number of smallest ASCII values to return. The function first converts the input string into a list of individual characters using the built-in `list()` method. Then, it sorts this list of characters by their ASCII value using the built-in `sorted()` method with a key argument set to `ord`. This ensures that the sorted list is in ascending order based on the ASCII values of each character.
After sorting the list of characters, the function returns the first `n` elements of this sorted list using slicing notation. This ensures that only the smallest `n` ASCII values are returned, regardless of whether there are more than `n` characters in the original string.
