Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[729, -212, 552, 823, -139, -918, -470, 977, 47, -5, -171, 880, 605, 699, -379, 982, -24, -267, 194, 826, 859, -553, 33, -715, -423, -714, 547, -806, 266, 637, -487, 863, 90, 444, 659, 232, 847, -700, -365, -798, 494, -849, 840, 741, 400, -324, -34, 146, -794, -276, -111, -353, 251, 311]

The correct answer was:
847

But the LLM code returned:
-111
