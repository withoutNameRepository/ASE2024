Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['063P%ez  d7YU  ZKVh  >8 4+23 @9  7hr3s80 6hSc5B9>5%0 Ylf7R5F6 7@ >']

The correct answer was:
063P%ez  d7YU  ZKV  >8 4+23 @9  7r3s80 6Sc5B9>5%0 Ylf7R5F6 7@ >

But the LLM code returned:
063P%z  7YU  ZKV  >8 4+23 @9  7r3s80 6S5B9>5%0 Y7R5F6 7@ >
