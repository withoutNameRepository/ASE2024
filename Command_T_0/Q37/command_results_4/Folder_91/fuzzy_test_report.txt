Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[' 284=x5b24L2 2b=w R4>5b2=n0H9 4xl2NzX% U 0a@3e6P']

The correct answer was:
 284=x5b24L2 2b=w R4>5b2=n0H9 4xl2NzX% U 0a@3e6P

But the LLM code returned:
 284=x5b24L2 2b=w R4>5b2=n09 4xl2NzX% U 0a@3e6P
