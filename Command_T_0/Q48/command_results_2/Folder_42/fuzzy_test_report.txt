Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 24, 26, 28, 31, 36, 37, 45, 46, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 61, 64, 68, 70, 72, 74, 75, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 87, 90, 93, 95, 96, 98, 102, 105, 109, 110, 112, 115, 116, 117, 118, 121, 122, 125, 127, 128, 130, 132, 135, 140, 141, 143, 145, 147, 148, 150, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 159, 160, 165, 166, 168, 173, 174, 179, 180, 181, 182, 184, 186, 187, 189, 192, 195, 197, 199, 200, 202, 205, 207, 209, 210, 211, 214, 216, 217, 220, 222, 224, 227, 228, 230, 231, 232]

The correct answer was:
E4C

But the LLM code returned:
1110101
