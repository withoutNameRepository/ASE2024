Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 29, 34, 37, 40, 43, 45, 46, 47, 51, 52, 53, 58, 66, 69, 70, 73, 74, 75, 76, 82, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 109, 110, 113, 116, 117, 119, 124, 125, 126, 127, 130, 134, 137]

The correct answer was:
5E8

But the LLM code returned:
