Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 83, 111, 127, 131, 140, 143, 144, 145, 151, 152, 154, 155, 156, 157, 159, 162, 168, 169, 170, 172, 174, 175, 177, 179, 181, 182, 184, 185, 186, 189, 195, 199, 200, 201, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209, 210, 213, 214, 215, 216, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 228, 229, 230, 234, 235, 236, 237, 241, 244, 247, 248, 251, 253, 254, 260, 261, 262, 264, 265, 266, 273, 276, 278, 280, 281, 282, 283, 285, 286, 287]

The correct answer was:
199E
