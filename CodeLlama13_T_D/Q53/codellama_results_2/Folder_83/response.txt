def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n):
    return set(word for word in string.split() if len(word) >= n and word == word[::-1])
```
This function splits the input string into individual words using the `str.split()` method, then filters out any words that are less than or equal to `n` characters long, and any words that do not consist of English letters. It then checks each remaining word to see if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (using the `word[::-1]` notation), and returns the set of all palindromes that are at least 60 characters long. If no such palindromes exist, the function returns an empty set.

Note: The function uses a generator expression to create a set of palindromes from the filtered words. This avoids the need to create a list of all possible palindromes and then filter it down to just those that are at least 60 characters long, which can be more efficient for large input strings.
