def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n):
    return {p for p in re.findall('[A-Za-z]+', string) if len(p) >= n and p == p[::-1]}
```
Note: This solution uses regular expressions to find all English letters in the input string, and then checks each candidate palindrome for length greater than or equal to `n` and for being a palindrome.
