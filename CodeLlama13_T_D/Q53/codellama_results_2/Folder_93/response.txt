```python
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):
    return {word for word in string.lower().split() if len(word) >= 90 and word == word[::-1]}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all the palindromes of length greater than or equal to 90 that exist in the given string. It splits the string into individual words, then checks each word for its length and whether it is a palindrome. If a word meets both criteria, it is added to the set of palindromes. The function uses `word[::-1]` to check if a word is a palindrome by reversing the word and checking if it matches the original word.
