def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):
    return {p for p in re.findall('[A-Za-z]{24,}', s) if p == p[::-1]}
```
Note: The code uses the `re` module to find all substrings of length greater than or equal to 24 that consist only of English letters, and then checks each substring to see if it is a palindrome.
