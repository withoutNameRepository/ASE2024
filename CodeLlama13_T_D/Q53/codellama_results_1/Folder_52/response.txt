```python
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string, n):
    return {word for word in string.split() if len(word) >= n and word == word[::-1]}
```
Note: The `palindrome_of_length_at_least_n` function takes a string and an integer `n` as input, and returns a set of palindromes that are at least `n` characters long. The function uses list comprehension to generate the set of all palindromes in the string. The `split()` method is used to split the string into individual words, and the `len()` function is used to check if each word is at least `n` characters long. The `==` operator is used to check if a word is a palindrome, and the `[::-1]` slice notation is used to check if the reverse of the word is equal to itself.
