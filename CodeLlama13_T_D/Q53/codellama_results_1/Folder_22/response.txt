def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(string):
    return {s for s in string.split() if len(s) >= 97 and s == s[::-1]}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all palindromes of length greater than or equal to 97 that exist in the given string. The `len` function is used to check the length of each word, and the `==` operator is used to check if the word is the same as its reverse. The `split` method is used to split the input string into a list of words, and the `s[::-1]` notation is used to get the reverse of each word.
