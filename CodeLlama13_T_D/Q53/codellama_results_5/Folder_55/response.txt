```python
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):
    return {pal for pal in re.findall(r'\b[a-zA-Z]{83,}\b', s) if pal == pal[::-1]}
```
Note: This solution uses the `re` module to find all occurrences of strings of length 83 or more that consist only of English letters, and then checks each string against its reverse to determine whether it is a palindrome. The `set` constructor is used to convert the resulting list into a set.
