```python
def palindrome_of_length_at_least_n(s):
    return {p for p in re.findall(r'[a-zA-Z]{115,}', s) if p == p[::-1]}
```
This function uses the `re` module to find all substrings of length greater than or equal to 115 that consist only of English letters, and then checks each substring to see if it is a palindrome using the reverse slice notation. The resulting set of palindromes is returned.
