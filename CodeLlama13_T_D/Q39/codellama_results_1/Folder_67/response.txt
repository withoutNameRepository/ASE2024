```python
def return_n_greatest_chars(string):
    chars = list(set(string))
    sorted_chars = sorted(chars, key=lambda x: ord(x), reverse=True)[:66]
    return sorted_chars
```
This function takes a string of distinct characters as input and returns a list of exactly 66 characters that have the greatest ASCII values. The function first creates a list of all the distinct characters in the input string using `set()`. Then, it sorts the list in descending order based on the ASCII value of each character using the `ord()` function, and keeps only the first 66 characters using slicing. Finally, it returns the sorted list as output.
Note that this function assumes that all characters in the input string are distinct. If there are duplicate characters in the input string, the behavior of this function is undefined.
