```
def return_n_greatest_chars(s):
    chars = set(s)
    sorted_chars = sorted(chars, key=lambda x: ord(x))
    return sorted_chars[-11:]
```
Note that this solution uses the `sorted` function with a custom `key` function to sort the list of characters based on their ASCII values. The `set` function is used to remove duplicates from the input string and the `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of each character. The resulting list is then sorted in ascending order and the last 11 elements are returned as a list.
