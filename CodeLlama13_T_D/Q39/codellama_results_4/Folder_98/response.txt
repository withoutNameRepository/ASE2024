```python
def return_n_greatest_chars(string):
    return sorted([char for char in string], key=ord, reverse=True)[:68]
```
Here is the breakdown of the code:

* `sorted`: Sorts the list based on the values returned by the `key` function. In this case, we use `ord`, which returns the ASCII value of a character.
* `[char for char in string]`: This creates a new list containing all the distinct characters from the input string.
* `[:68]`: Slices the sorted list to get only the first 68 elements (since there are 94 unique characters in the English alphabet, and we want exactly 68).

This function returns a sorted list of exactly 68 characters with the greatest ASCII values from the input string.
