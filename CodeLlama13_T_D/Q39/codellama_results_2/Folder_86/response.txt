```python
def return_n_greatest_chars(string):
    chars = sorted(set(string), key=ord, reverse=True)[:34]
    return ''.join(chars)
```
This function takes a string of distinct characters as input and returns the sorted list of exactly 34 characters that have the greatest ASCII values. The `sorted` function is used with a custom `key` argument to sort the characters by their ASCII values in descending order, while the `set` function is used to remove duplicates from the input string. Finally, the first 34 elements of the sorted list are returned as a string.
