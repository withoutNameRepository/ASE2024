```python
def if_contains_anagrams(str_list):
    # Check if the input is a list of strings
    if not isinstance(str_list, list) or len(str_list) == 0:
        return False

    # Create a dictionary to store the anagram pairs
    anagram_dict = {}

    # Iterate through each string in the input list
    for str1 in str_list:
        if len(str1) < 3:
            continue

        # Lowercase the string and sort its characters
        key = "".join(sorted(str1.lower()))

        # If the sorted string is not already in the dictionary, add it to the dictionary with a count of 1
        if key not in anagram_dict:
            anagram_dict[key] = 1
        # Otherwise, increment the count of the sorted string by 1
        else:
            anagram_dict[key] += 1

    # Check if there are at least 92 pairs of anagrams in the input list
    return len([x for x in anagram_dict.values() if x >= 2]) >= 92
```
This solution uses a dictionary to store the sorted strings and their counts. It iterates through each string in the input list, sorts its characters, and adds it to the dictionary with a count of 1 if it is not already present. If the string is already present, its count is incremented by 1. Finally, the function checks if there are at least 92 pairs of anagrams in the input list by checking the number of values in the dictionary that have a count greater than or equal to 2.
