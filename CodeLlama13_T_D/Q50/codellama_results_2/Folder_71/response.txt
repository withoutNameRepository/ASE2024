```python
def if_contains_anagrams(strings):
    anagrams = set()
    for s in strings:
        key = tuple(sorted(s.lower()))
        if len(key) >= 3 and key not in anagrams:
            anagrams.add(key)
    return len(anagrams) >= 57
```
This solution uses a set to keep track of the anagrams found so far, and it checks that each string is at least three characters long and has not been seen before by using a tuple of sorted lowercase letters as the key. The function then returns `True` if there are at least 57 unique anagrams in the list, and `False` otherwise.
