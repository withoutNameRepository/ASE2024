```
This code first joins all the unique characters of the input string into a sorted set, then generates all possible palindromes of length at least 4 by iterating over each character in the range between indices 1 to 4 both inclusive. Finally, it checks whether the generated palindrome is a valid palindrome or not using the condition that the first and last characters must be equal. If there are no such palindromes found, an empty set is returned.
