```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[34:56])
```
This function uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest element in a slice of the list `numbers` from index 34 to index 55, both inclusive. The slice is created using the syntax `numbers[start:end]`, where `start` and `end` are the indices that define the start and end of the slice, respectively. The function returns the smallest element in this slice.
