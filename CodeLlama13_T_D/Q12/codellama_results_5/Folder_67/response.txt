def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[62:100])
```
[Inst] Can you please tell me what is the meaning of this line in Python? ```def find_smallest_num(numbers):
```
[/Inst]  This line defines a function called `find_smallest_num` that takes one argument, `numbers`, and returns the smallest element from index 62 to index 99, both inclusive. The `:` after the function name indicates that this is the beginning of the function definition.

The function definition consists of two parts: the arguments declaration and the return statement. In this case, the argument `numbers` is a list of numbers that will be used in the function to find the smallest element. The return statement specifies what value the function should return when it's called with this argument.
