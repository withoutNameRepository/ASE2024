```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    smallest = float('inf')
    for i in range(5):
        if numbers[i] < smallest:
            smallest = numbers[i]
    return smallest
```
Note that the `float('inf')` is used to set an initial value for the smallest number, which is the largest possible floating point number. This ensures that the first element of the list will be returned as the smallest if it is less than or equal to all other elements in the list.
