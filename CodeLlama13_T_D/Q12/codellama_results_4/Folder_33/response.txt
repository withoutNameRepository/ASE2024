```
Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_unique_elements' that takes one argument, a list of numbers, and returns a new list containing only the elements from the original list that appear exactly once.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
```python
def find_unique_elements(my_list):
    unique_elements = []
    for element in my_list:
        if my_list.count(element) == 1:
            unique_elements.append(element)
    return unique_elements
```
