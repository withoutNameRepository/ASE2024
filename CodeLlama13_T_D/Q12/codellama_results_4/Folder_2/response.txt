```python
def find_smallest_num(my_list):
    return min(my_list[40:81])
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest element from index 40 to index 80, both inclusive. It does this by first slicing the list from indices 40 to 80 using the `:` notation, and then calling the built-in `min()` function on that slice. The resulting value is returned as the output of the function.
