```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    smallest = None
    for i in range(0, 9):
        if smallest is None or numbers[i] < smallest:
            smallest = numbers[i]
    return smallest
```
Note: The `None` value represents the absence of a value. In Python, it is used as a default value when a function does not have a specified argument.
