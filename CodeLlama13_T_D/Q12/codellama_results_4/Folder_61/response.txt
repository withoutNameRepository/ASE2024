```python
def find_smallest_num(nums):
    return min(nums[0:7])
```
Note: This function uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest element in the list, and it returns the element at index 0.

Also note that this function only works for lists of length 7 or more, if the list is shorter than 7 elements, it will raise an error.
