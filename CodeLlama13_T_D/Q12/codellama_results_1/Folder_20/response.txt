```python
def find_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[75:89][0]
```
This function uses slicing to extract the elements from index 75 to index 88, both inclusive, and then sorts the resulting sublist. Finally, it returns the first element of this sorted sublist, which is the smallest number among those indices.
