```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[22:51])
```
You can also use the following function, which is similar but uses slicing and the `min` function instead of a for loop.
```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[22:51])
```
Both functions will return the smallest element from index 22 to index 50, both inclusive, in the list `numbers`.
