```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers[0:4])[0]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest element from index 0 to index 3, both inclusive. It does this by first sorting the list using `sorted()`, then returning the first element of the resulting list.
