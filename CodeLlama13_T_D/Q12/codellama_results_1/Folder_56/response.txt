```
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[1:9])
```
Note that this function uses the `min` built-in function, which returns the smallest element of a list or other iterable. The `[1:9]` syntax is used to create a new list containing only the elements from index 1 (inclusive) to index 8 (exclusive).
