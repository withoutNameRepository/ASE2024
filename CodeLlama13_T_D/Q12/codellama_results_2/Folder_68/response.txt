```
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[0:8])
```
Please note that this function assumes the list of numbers has at least 8 elements, and it returns the smallest element from indices 0 to 7 both inclusive. If you want to find the smallest element in a list with less than 8 elements, you can modify the function accordingly or use a different approach.
