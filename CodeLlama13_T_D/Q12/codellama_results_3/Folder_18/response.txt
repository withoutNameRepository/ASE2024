```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[15:40])
```
Note that this function uses the built-in `min` function, which returns the smallest element from a list of numbers. The slice notation `[15:40]` is used to select the sublist containing the elements at indices 15 through 39 (both inclusive).
