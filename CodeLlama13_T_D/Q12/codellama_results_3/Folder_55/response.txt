```python
def find_smallest_num(numbers):
    return min(numbers[0:10])
```
Note that this function uses the built-in `min` function, which takes a list of numbers and returns the smallest element in the list. The code only considers elements from index 0 to index 9, both inclusive, by using slicing notation `[0:10]`.
