```python
def find_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list[4:8])[0]
```
Note: The `sorted` function sorts the list and returns a new sorted list, so we need to take the first element of that list. Also, Python indexes start from 0, so we need to use indices 4 through 7 (inclusive) instead of indices 5 through 8.
