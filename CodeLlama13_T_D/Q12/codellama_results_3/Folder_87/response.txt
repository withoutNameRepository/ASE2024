```
def find_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[56:83][0]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the smallest number from indices 56 to 82, both inclusive. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and then the slice operator `[56:83]` is used to extract the desired range of elements. Finally, the first element of the resulting list is returned using the `[0]` indexer.
