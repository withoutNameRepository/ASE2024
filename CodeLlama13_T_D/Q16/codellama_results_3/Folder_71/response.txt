```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(26, 53):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
This code defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function uses a loop to iterate over the specified range (from index 26 to index 52, both inclusive) and checks if each integer is even by using the modulo operator (`%`). If an even integer is found, it adds its value to a running total called `result`. Finally, the function returns `result`, which contains the sum of all even integers from the specified range.
