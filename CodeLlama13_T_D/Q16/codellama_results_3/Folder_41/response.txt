```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if i >= 6 and x % 2 == 0) or 0
```
This is a concise and efficient solution that uses the `sum` function to calculate the total of all even integers from index 6 to the end of the list. The `enumerate` function is used to iterate over the indices and values in the list, and the `if` statement is used to check if each value is an even integer and within the specified range. If no such integers exist, the function returns 0.
