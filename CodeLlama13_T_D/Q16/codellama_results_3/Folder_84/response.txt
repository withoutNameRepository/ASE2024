    for i in range(43, 87):

Explanation:

The function takes a list of integers as input and iterates through it using a for loop. It checks if each integer is even by using the modulo operator (%). If an integer is even, it adds its value to the running total, which is initially set to 0. The result is returned at the end of the function.

The range() function is used to iterate through indices 43 to 86 both inclusive.
