```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst[56:83])) or 0
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. The function uses the `filter` function to filter out non-even numbers from the list, and then uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the remaining numbers.
