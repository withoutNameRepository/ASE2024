    sliced_list = my_list[25:60]
    # Filter out any odd integers in the sliced list
    filtered_list = [x for x in sliced_list if x % 2 == 0]

```
This code defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. The function uses slicing to extract the relevant portion of the input list, filters out any odd integers using a list comprehension, and then sums up all remaining even integers using the `sum` built-in function.
