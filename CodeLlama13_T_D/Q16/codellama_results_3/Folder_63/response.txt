```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(22, 89):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```

Note: This code assumes that the list contains at least 67 elements (from index 22 to index 88, both inclusive). If there are less than 67 elements in the list, this function will raise an `IndexError`.
