def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(int(i) for i in my_list[13:69] if int(i) % 2 == 0) or 0
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 13 to index 68, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, it returns 0. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the list, check if each element is an even integer, and return its value if it is, or 0 if it is not.
