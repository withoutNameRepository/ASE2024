def sum_even_ints_inclusive(lst):
    # Slice the list from index 310 to index 370, both inclusive
    sliced = lst[310:371]
    # Find all even integers in the sliced list
    evens = [i for i in sliced if i % 2 == 0]
    # Return the sum of all even integers, or 0 if no even integers exist
    return sum(evens) if evens else 0
```
This function takes a single argument `lst`, which should be a list of integers. It returns the sum of all even integers in the list from index 310 to index 370, both inclusive, or 0 if no even integers exist in that range.
