```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0 and i <= 8:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
This code defines a function `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input, and returns the sum of all even integers in the list from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the list, and checks if the current element is an even integer using the modulo operator (%). If the current element is an even integer and its index is less than or equal to 8, the function adds it to the result using the `+=` operator.

For example, if we call the function with a list of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it will return the sum of all even integers in the list from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive, which is `2 + 4 = 6`. If we call the function with an empty list or a list that contains no even integers, it will return 0.
