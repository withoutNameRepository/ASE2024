    for i in range(30, 201):

```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all even integers from index 30 to index 200, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, it will return 0. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices between 30 and 200, and checks if each element is an even integer using the modulo operator (%). If an even integer is found, it adds its value to the total sum.
