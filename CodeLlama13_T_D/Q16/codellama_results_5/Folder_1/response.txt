```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list[31:72+1] if x % 2 == 0]) or 0
```
This function uses list comprehension to generate a list of even numbers between indices 31 and 72, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of these numbers. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
