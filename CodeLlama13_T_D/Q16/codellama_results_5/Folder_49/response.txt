```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list[8:81] if i % 2 == 0)
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 8 to index 80, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, it returns 0.

Here's an example usage:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list)) # Output: 30 (since the even integers are 8, 10, and 2)
```
