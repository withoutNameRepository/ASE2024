```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(n for i, n in enumerate(nums) if i <= 1 and n % 2 == 0) or 0
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices and values of `nums`, and checks if each value is even and if its index is between 0 and 1 (both inclusive). If an even integer exists in this range, it returns its sum; otherwise, it returns 0.
