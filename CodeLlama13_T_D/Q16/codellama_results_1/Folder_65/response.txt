```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if 56 <= i <= 98 and x % 2 == 0) or 0
```
This code defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as its argument. The function uses a generator expression with the `enumerate()` function to iterate over the indices and values of the list, and checks if each value is even and within the specified range (56-98). If any even integer exists in this range, it is added to the sum using the `sum()` function. Finally, the function returns 0 if no even integers exist in the range.
