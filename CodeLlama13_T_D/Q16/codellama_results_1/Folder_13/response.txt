```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst[25:88] if i % 2 == 0) or 0
```
This function uses a generator expression to extract all even integers from the list, and then uses the built-in `sum` function to calculate their sum. The `or 0` part is used to return 0 if there are no even integers in the specified range.
