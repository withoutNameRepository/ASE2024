```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list[310:371] if i % 2 == 0)
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all even integers from index 310 to index 370, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

Note that the list is sliced using `my_list[310:371]` to get a sub-list containing only the elements between indices 310 and 370, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of all even integers in this sub-list.

Also note that the `if` statement checks if each integer is even using the modulo operator (`i % 2 == 0`) before adding it to the sum.
