```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    total = 0
    for i in range(4):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
    return total
```
Note that this function only works on lists of integers and will not work on other types of data. Also, the function name is a bit misleading, as it doesn't include index 4, which is an even integer in the specified range.
