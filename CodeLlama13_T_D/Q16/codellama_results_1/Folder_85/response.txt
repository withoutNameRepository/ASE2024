    return sum([x for x in my_list[6:9] if x % 2 == 0])
```
This is a function named `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all even integers from index 6 to index 8, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0. The function uses a list comprehension to get only the even numbers between indices 6 and 8 (inclusive), and then sums them using the `sum()` function.
