```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return sum(number for i, number in enumerate(numbers) if 22 <= i <= 50 and number % 2 == 0) or 0
```
Note: This solution uses a generator expression to iterate over the list of numbers, and checks each number to see if it is even using the modulo operator. The `enumerate()` function is used to get the index of each number in the list, which is then checked to be between 22 and 50 (both inclusive). If no even integers are found in the specified range, the function returns 0.
