```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if 533 <= i <= 605 and x % 2 == 0) or 0
```
Please note that this code assumes that the indices are zero-based. If you want to use one-based indexing, you can modify the conditions accordingly:
```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if 534 <= i <= 606 and x % 2 == 0) or 0
```
