```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(52, 71+1):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
Note that the `range` function returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first argument and up to but not including the second argument. The `+1` in `71+1` is needed because we want to include the number at index 71 in our calculation.
