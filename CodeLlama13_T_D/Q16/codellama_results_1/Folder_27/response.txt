```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    total = 0
    for i in range(66, 94):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += my_list[i]
    return total
```
This code creates a function `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks if each element is even using the modulo operator `%`. If an even integer is found, it adds its value to a total variable. Finally, the function returns the total or 0 if no even integers are found in the specified range.
