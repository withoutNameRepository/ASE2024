```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([i for i in my_list[32:36] if i % 2 == 0]) or 0
```
This code defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 32 to index 35, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

* The first line defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 32 to index 35, both inclusive.
* The second line uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even integers in the specified range. This is done by using the `i for i` syntax, which creates a list where each element is equal to `i`. The `if i % 2 == 0` part of the list comprehension ensures that only even integers are included in the list.
* The third line uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of all elements in the new list. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0 because `sum([])` evaluates to 0.

Overall, this code is a concise and efficient way to solve the problem described in the text specification.
