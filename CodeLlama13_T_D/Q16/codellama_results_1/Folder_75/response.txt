```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list[56:58] if i % 2 == 0)
```
Explanation:

* The function takes a list of integers as its argument.
* The `sum()` function is used to add up all even integers from index 56 to index 57, both inclusive.
* The `if` statement checks if each integer in the range is even before adding it to the sum.
* If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
