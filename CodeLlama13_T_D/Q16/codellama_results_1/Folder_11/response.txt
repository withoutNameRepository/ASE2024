```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(37, 52):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 37 to index 51, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the specified range and checks if each integer is even using the modulo operator (%). If an even integer is found, its value is added to the result variable, which is initialized with 0 before the for loop. Finally, the result variable is returned by the function.
