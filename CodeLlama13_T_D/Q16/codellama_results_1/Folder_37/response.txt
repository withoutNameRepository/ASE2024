```
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
Note that this function uses the `range` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 5 (both inclusive), and then checks whether each number is even or not using the modulo operator (`%`). If an even number is found, it is added to the `result` variable. Finally, the function returns the value of `result`.
