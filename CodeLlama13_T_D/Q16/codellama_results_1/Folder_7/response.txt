```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    total = 0
    for i in range(661, 925):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += nums[i]
    return total
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers between indices 661 and 924, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in this range, it returns 0. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the specified range of indices and checks if each integer is even using the modulo operator. If an even integer is found, its value is added to a running total, which is returned at the end of the function.
