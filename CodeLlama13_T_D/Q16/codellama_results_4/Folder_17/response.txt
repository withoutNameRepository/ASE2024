```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list[62:79] if x % 2 == 0]) or 0
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers between indices 62 and 78, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in this range, it will return 0 instead.

Here's an example usage:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list)) # Output: 22
```
