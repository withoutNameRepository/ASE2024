```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(3,6):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, it will return 0. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices in the range of interest, and checks each element to see if it is an even integer using the modulo operator (%). If an even integer is found, its value is added to the result variable. Finally, the result is returned as the final output of the function.
