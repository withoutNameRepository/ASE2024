```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 0][:9])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of even integers from the input list, and then takes the sum of that list. The `[:9]` slice is used to limit the result to only the first nine elements of the list, which corresponds to indices 0 through 8 (both inclusive). If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.
