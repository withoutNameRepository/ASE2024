def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([n for n in my_list[0:7] if n % 2 == 0]) or 0
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even integers from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then called on this list to calculate the total sum of all even integers. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
