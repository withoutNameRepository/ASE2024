```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(52, 71+1):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
The code above defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. It uses a for loop to iterate over the specified range of indices (52 to 71), and checks if each element is even using the modulo operator. If an even integer is found, it is added to the `result` variable, which is initialized to zero. Finally, the function returns the value of `result`.
