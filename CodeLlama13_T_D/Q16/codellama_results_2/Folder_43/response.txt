```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if i >= 68 and i <= 86 and num % 2 == 0)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `nums` list, and for each number `num`, it checks whether its index `i` is between 68 and 86 (both inclusive), and whether the number is even. If both conditions are true, then the number is included in the sum.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only positive numbers, as it uses the modulo operator `%` to check for evenness. If the input list can contain negative numbers, you will need to modify the function accordingly.
