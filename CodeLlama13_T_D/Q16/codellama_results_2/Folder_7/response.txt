```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum([n for n in nums[661:924+1] if n % 2 == 0]) or 0
```
This is a concise solution that uses list comprehension to filter the even integers from the specified range, and then uses the `sum()` function to calculate their sum. If there are no even integers in the range, it returns 0.
