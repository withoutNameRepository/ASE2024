```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    result = 0
    for i in range(14, 65):
        if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:
            result += numbers[i]
    return result
```
Note that this code assumes that the input list is valid and contains only integers. It also uses the `range` function to iterate over the specified range of indices, and the `%` operator to check if a number is even.
