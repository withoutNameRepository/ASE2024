```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list[21:50+1] if x % 2 == 0]) or 0
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of even integers between indices 21 and 50, inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of these even integers. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
