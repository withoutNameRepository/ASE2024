```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([num for i, num in enumerate(my_list) if i >= 6 and num % 2 == 0])
```
This code defines a function called `sum_even_ints_inclusive` that takes a single argument `my_list`, which should be a list of integers. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even numbers in the range from index 6 (inclusive) to the end of the original list. It then uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of these numbers. If no even numbers exist in this range, the function returns 0.

Here is an example usage:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list)) # Output: 20
```
In this example, the function returns the sum of all even numbers from index 6 (inclusive) to the end of the list. Since there are no odd numbers in this range, the function returns 20, which is the sum of all even numbers in the list.
