```python
def sum_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list[19:93] if x % 2 == 0])
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all even integers from index 19 to index 92, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. The list comprehension `[x for x in my_list[19:93] if x % 2 == 0]` generates a new list containing all even numbers from the input list between indices 19 and 92 (both inclusive). The `sum()` function then sums up these even integers.
