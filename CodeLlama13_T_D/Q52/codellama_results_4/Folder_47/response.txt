```
def palindrome_of_length_n(s):
    return {p for p in findall(r'([A-Za-z]{34})', s) if p == p[::-1]}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to generate the palindromes of length 34, and then checks each palindrome against its reverse using the `p[::-1]` syntax. If the palindrome is equal to its reverse, it is added to the set. The result is returned as an unordered set.

Note that this solution only works for strings containing letters in the range A-Za-z, and does not handle any special characters or whitespace.
