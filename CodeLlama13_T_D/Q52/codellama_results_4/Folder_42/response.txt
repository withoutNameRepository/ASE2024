```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(s):
    return {p for p in re.findall('(?i)[a-z]{279}', s) if p == p[::-1]}
```
This code uses a regular expression to find all substrings of length 279 that consist only of English letters, and then checks each substring to see if it is a palindrome. The `(?i)` flag at the beginning of the regular expression tells Python to perform the match in a case-insensitive manner.
