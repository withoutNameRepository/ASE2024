```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    return {pal for pal in re.findall("[a-zA-Z]{54}", string) if pal == pal[::-1]}
```
This function uses regular expressions to find all substrings of length 54 that consist only of English letters, and then checks whether each substring is a palindrome by reversing it and comparing it with the original. The resulting set contains all palindromes of length 54 found in the given string.
