```
def palindrome_of_length_n(s):
    return set(filter(lambda x: len(x) == 29 and x[::-1] == x, re.findall("([a-zA-Z]{29})", s)))
```
This function uses regular expressions to find all substrings of length 29 in the input string `s`, and then filters out any non-palindromes using a lambda function that checks if the substring is equal to its reverse. The result is returned as a set.
