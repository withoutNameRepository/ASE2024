```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(s):
    return set([x for x in re.findall("[A-Za-z]{47}", s) if x == x[::-1]])
```
Note: This solution uses the `re` module to find all substrings of length 47 that consist only of English letters, and then checks each substring to see if it is a palindrome. If it is, it is added to the set of palindromes that are returned by the function.
