```python
def palindrome_of_length_n(string):
    return {palindrome for palindrome in re.findall("[A-Za-z]{" + str(47) + "}", string)}
```
This function uses the `re` module to find all substrings of length 47 that match the regular expression `[A-Za-z]{47}`, which matches any sequence of English letters with a length of exactly 47. The resulting set of palindromes is then returned as the output of the function.
