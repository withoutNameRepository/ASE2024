def palindrome_of_length_n(string, n):
    return {s for s in re.findall('[a-zA-Z]{' + str(n) + '}', string)}
```
This function uses a regular expression to find all substrings of the specified length (181) that consist only of English letters. It then returns a set of all palindromes found in the given string, or an empty set if no palindromes are found.
