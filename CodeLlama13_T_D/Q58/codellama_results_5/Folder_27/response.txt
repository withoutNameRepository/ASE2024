```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    rows = len(matrix)
    cols = len(matrix[0])
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(rows - n + 1):
        for j in range(cols - n + 1):
            submatrix = matrix[i:i+n,j:j+n]
            if np.all(submatrix == 77):
                count += 1
                
    return count
```
This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as input and returns the number of submatrices that contain all 77 integers. The function works by iterating over the rows and columns of the input matrix, extracting submatrices of size n x n, and checking if they are equal to 77. If a submatrix is found that contains all 77 integers, the count is incremented.
