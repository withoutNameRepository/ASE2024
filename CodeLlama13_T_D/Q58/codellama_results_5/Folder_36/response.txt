```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(matrix) - n + 1):
        for j in range(len(matrix[0]) - n + 1):
            if all([np.count_nonzero(row[j:j+n]) == n for row in matrix[i:i+n]]):
                count += 1
    return count
```
This function uses nested `for` loops to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix, and checks if each submatrix with size `n x n` contains exactly `n` non-zero integers. The `all()` function is used to check if all the rows in the submatrix have at least `n` non-zero integers. If a matching submatrix is found, the count is incremented by 1 and returned at the end of the function.
