```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):
            if (matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n] == n).all():
                count += 1
    return count
```
Note: This function uses the `numpy` library to perform matrix operations. The `shape` attribute of a numpy matrix returns a tuple containing the number of rows and columns in the matrix. The `all()` method is used to check if all elements in a submatrix are equal to `n`.
