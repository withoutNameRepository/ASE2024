This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input and returns the count of all submatrices of the given matrix that contain 144 integers each. The function iterates over each row and column in the matrix, initializes a submatrix with size (4, 4) centered at each position, fills it with values from the original matrix, and checks if the submatrix contains 144 integers. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns 0.
