This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix and an integer `n` as input. It then iterates through all possible submatrices of the given matrix with size `n x n`, checks if each submatrix contains exactly `n**2` non-zero elements, and returns the count of such submatrices. If no such submatrix is found, it returns 0.
