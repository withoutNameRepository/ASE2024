This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input and returns an integer representing the number of submatrices with 24 integers each that are found in the given matrix. The function uses nested loops to iterate through each row and column of the matrix, and checks if there is a submatrix with a size of 24 elements by slicing the matrix at each position. If all elements in the submatrix are equal to 1, the function increments a counter variable `count`. The function returns `count` as the final output.
