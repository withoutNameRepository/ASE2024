```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    n = 53
    count = 0
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - n + 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - n + 1):
            submatrix = matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n]
            if np.count_nonzero(submatrix == n) == n**2:
                count += 1
    return count
```
Note that this function uses the `np.count_nonzero` function to check if a submatrix contains exactly `n` integers, and it increments the count variable only when such a submatrix is found. The loop iterates over all possible starting indices for the submatrix, and checks if there exists a contiguous submatrix of size `n` that contains exactly `n` integers.
