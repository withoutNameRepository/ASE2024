```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
            if matrix[i][j] == 78:
                count += 1
    return count
```
Note that this function will only check the main diagonal of the matrix and not any other submatrices. If you need to search for submatrices in a larger region, you may need to modify the function accordingly.
