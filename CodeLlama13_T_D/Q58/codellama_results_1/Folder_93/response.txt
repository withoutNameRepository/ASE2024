```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_n_numbers(matrix, n):
    rows, cols = matrix.shape
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(rows - n + 1):
        for j in range(cols - n + 1):
            if len(set(matrix[i:i+n, j:j+n].flatten())) == n:
                count += 1
                
    return count
```
This code uses the `numpy` library to perform fast and efficient operations on matrices. The function first checks if the matrix is a two-dimensional numpy array of integers using `isinstance`. Then, it loops through each submatrix of size `n x n`, flattens it into a one-dimensional list, and checks if the length of the set of elements in the submatrix is equal to `n`. If so, the count is increased by 1. Finally, the function returns the total count of all submatrices that contain 53 integers each.
