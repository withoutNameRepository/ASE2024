This code defines a function `submatrix_with_n_numbers` that takes a two-dimensional matrix of integers as input. The function iterates over each element in the matrix and checks if there is a submatrix with 24 elements that contains all unique numbers from 0 to n-1 (where n is the number of rows or columns in the matrix). If such a submatrix is found, the function increments a counter variable `count` by 1. Finally, the function returns the value of `count`.
