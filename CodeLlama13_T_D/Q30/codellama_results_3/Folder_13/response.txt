```python
def insert_before_character(s):
    return "".join("N" + c if c == "x" else c for c in s)
```
Note that this is a concise version of the function, which uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the string `s`, and inserts an `'N'` before any occurrence of `'x'`. The resulting string is then joined back into a single string using `"".join()`.
