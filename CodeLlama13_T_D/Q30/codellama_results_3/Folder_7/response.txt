```python
def insert_before_character(s, c):
    return s.replace(' ', f'{c} ')
```
This function takes two arguments: `s`, the string to modify, and `c`, the character to insert. It returns a new string that is identical to `s` except that any occurrences of the space character (`' '`) have been replaced by the space character followed by the `c` character.

For example, calling this function with `s = "Hello World"` and `c = "H"` would return `"HHellWorld"`.
