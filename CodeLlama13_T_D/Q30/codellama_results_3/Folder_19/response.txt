def insert_before_character(string, character):
    return "".join([f"{character}h" if c == character else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, and for each character it checks if it is equal to the specified character. If it is, then it adds the `character` and `h` characters together, otherwise it returns just the original character. Finally, it joins all the resulting characters into a new string using the `"".join()` method.
