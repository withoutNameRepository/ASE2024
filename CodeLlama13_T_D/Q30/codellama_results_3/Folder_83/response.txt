```python
def insert_before_character(string, char):
    return "".join([char if c == char else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string and inserts the character 'e' immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'E'. The output is then joined into a single string using the "".join() method.
