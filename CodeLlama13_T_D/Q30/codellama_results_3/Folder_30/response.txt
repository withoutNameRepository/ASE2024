```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != 'F' else f"F{char}" for char in string])
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over each character in the input `string`. If the current character is not `'F'`, it is added to the output unchanged. Otherwise, it is replaced with a string consisting of `'F'` followed by the original character. The resulting string is then joined back together using `"".join()`.
