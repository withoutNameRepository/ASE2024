def insert_before_character(s):
    return s.replace('U', 'a' + 'U')
```
This function takes a string `s` as an argument and returns a new string where the character `'a'` is inserted immediately before any occurrences of character `'U'`. The `.replace()` method is used to replace all occurrences of `'U'` with `'a' + 'U'`, which effectively inserts `'a'` immediately before each occurrence of `'U'`.
