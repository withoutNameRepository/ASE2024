```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join([f"n{c}" if c == "a" else c for c in string])
```
This code defines a function called `insert_before_character` that takes a single argument, `string`, and returns a new string with the character 'n' inserted immediately before any occurrences of the character 'a'. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in `string` and either include it unchanged or prepend it with an 'n', depending on whether it is an 'a'. The resulting characters are then joined together into a single string.
