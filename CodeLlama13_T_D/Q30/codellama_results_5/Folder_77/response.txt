```python
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join("h" + c if c == "9" else c for c in string)
```
This code defines a function `insert_before_character` that takes a single argument `string`. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters of the input string, and inserts the character 'h' immediately before any occurrences of the character '9'. The resulting string is then returned.

For example:
```python
print(insert_before_character("hello9world"))  # Output: "helhlo9worlhld"
```
