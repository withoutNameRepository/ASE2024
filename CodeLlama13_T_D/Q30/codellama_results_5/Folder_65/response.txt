```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join("9" if char == "6" else char for char in string)
```
This is a generator function that uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `string`, inserting `"9"` immediately before each character `"6"`. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a single string using the empty string as the separator.
