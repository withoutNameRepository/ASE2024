```python
def insert_before_character(s, c):
    return "".join([f"w{c}" if c == "r" else c for c in s])
```
This function takes a string `s` and a character `c`, and returns a new string where the character `c` has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character `'r'`. The function does this by using list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and inserting the character `c` before any occurrence of `'r'` while leaving other characters unchanged.
