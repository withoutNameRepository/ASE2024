```
def insert_before_character(string, character):
    return "".join([f"{character}u" if c == character else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and inserts the character 'u' before any occurrences of the character 'X'. The resulting string is then joined into a single string using the "".join() method.
