```python
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join([f"h{char}" if char == "9" else char for char in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `string`, and inserts an `'h'` before any occurrences of `'9'`. The resulting string is then returned.
