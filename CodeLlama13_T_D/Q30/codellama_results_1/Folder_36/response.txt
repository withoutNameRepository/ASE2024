```
def insert_before_character(s, c):
    return "".join([f"H{c}" if c == 'A' else c for c in s])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and for any occurrence of `'A'` it inserts an `'H'` immediately preceding it. The resulting characters are then joined into a new string using the `"".join()` method.
