```
def insert_before_character(string, char):
    return "".join([char if c == 'H' else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string and check whether each character is 'H'. If it is, the function inserts 'n' before that character. The resulting list is then joined into a single string using the "".join() method.
