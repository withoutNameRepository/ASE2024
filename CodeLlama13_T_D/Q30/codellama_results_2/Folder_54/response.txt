```
def insert_before_character(string, char):
    return "".join([f"{char}f" if c == char else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and inserts the character 'f' immediately before any occurrences of the character 'M'. The resulting list is then joined into a single string using the "".join() method.
