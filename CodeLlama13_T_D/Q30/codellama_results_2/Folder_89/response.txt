```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != " " else f"W{char}" for char in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and checks if each character is equal to `' '` (space). If it is, the function adds the character `'W'` before the space, and then adds the space character. If the character is not a space, the function simply adds that character to the output string. The `join()` method is then used to concatenate all of the characters in the list into a single string.
