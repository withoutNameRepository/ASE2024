def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join([x if x != "E" else f"E{x}" for x in string])
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over the characters of the input string and inserts an "E" before any character "e", while keeping all other characters unchanged. The `f-string` is used to create the new characters.
