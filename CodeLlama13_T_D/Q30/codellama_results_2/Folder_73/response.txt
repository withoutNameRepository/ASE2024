```python
def insert_before_character(string, character):
    return "".join([f"{character}V" if c == character else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `string`. If a character is equal to `character`, it is replaced with `'V' + character` (i.e., the `character` is inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of `character`). Otherwise, the original character is retained. The resulting list of characters is then joined into a single string using the `"".join()` method.
