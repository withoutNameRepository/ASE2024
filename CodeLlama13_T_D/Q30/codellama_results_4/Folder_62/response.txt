```
def insert_before_character(s):
    return "".join([f"o{c}" if c == " " else c for c in s])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `s`, and inserts an 'o' immediately preceding any occurrences of ' '. The resulting string is then joined using the empty string as a separator.
