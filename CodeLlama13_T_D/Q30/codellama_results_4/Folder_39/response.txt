```
def insert_before_character(s, char):
    return "".join([f"Q{c}" if c == 'm' else c for c in s])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string `s`, and inserts the character `'Q'` before any occurrences of the character `'m'`. The resulting string is then joined into a new string using the `"".join()` method.
