```
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "u" else f"u{char}" for char in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and inserts a new character `u` before each occurrence of the character `F`. The resulting string is then joined using the empty string as the separator.
