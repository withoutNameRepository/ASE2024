```
def insert_before_character(string, char):
    return "".join([char if c == char else c for c in string])
```
This function takes a string and a character as input and returns a new string with the character inserted immediately before all occurrences of that character. The `join` method is used to concatenate the characters in the original string into a new string, while the list comprehension is used to insert the character `char` before each occurrence of the character `o`.

For example:
```
insert_before_character("hello", "h")  # returns "hhheeello"
```
This inserts an additional 'h' in front of all occurrences of 'o', resulting in "hhheeello".
