```python
def find_original_set(args):
    return {item for arg in args for item in arg}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to collect all the elements from each argument and returns the smallest possible set containing all of them. The `for` loop inside the set comprehension iterates over each argument and `item in arg` extracts the individual items from each set.
