```
def find_original_set(set1, set2):
    return set()
```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes two arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. The implementation uses the `set()` constructor to create an empty set.
