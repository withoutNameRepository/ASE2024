```
def find_original_set(arg1, arg2, ... , arg926):
    original_set = set()
    for argument in (arg1, arg2, ... , arg926):
        original_set |= argument
    return original_set
```
This code defines a function called `find_original_set` that takes exactly 926 arguments, each of which is a set of integers. The function returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it.

The implementation uses a union operation `|=` to combine all the arguments into a single set. This ensures that the resulting set contains all the elements from all the input sets.

Note that this code only works if the input sets are disjoint, meaning that they do not have any common elements. If the input sets can contain duplicates or overlapping elements, you may need to modify the implementation accordingly.
