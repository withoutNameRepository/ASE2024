    original_set = set()
    
    # Iterate over all arguments and add them to the original set if they are not already present
    for i in range(len(locals())):

```
This function takes 69 arguments, each of which is a set of integers. It returns the smallest set such that each of the given arguments is a subset of it. The implementation uses the `|=` operator to add the elements of each argument to the `original_set` if they are not already present.
