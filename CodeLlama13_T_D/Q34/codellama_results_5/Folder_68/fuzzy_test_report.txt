Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[frozenset({-16, 43, 75, 20}), frozenset({-63, 36, -21, 80, -76, -75, 54, 58, -36, 93, -65}), frozenset({3, -90, 7, -23, 49, -45, -34, 22, -9, 24, 94, 29, 30, -65})]

The correct answer was:
{-63, 3, 7, 75, 80, -45, 20, 22, 24, -36, 93, -34, 94, 29, 30, 36, -90, -23, 43, -21, -16, 49, -76, -75, 54, -9, 58, -65}

But the LLM code returned:
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, -16, -15, -14, -13, -12, -11, -10, -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1}
