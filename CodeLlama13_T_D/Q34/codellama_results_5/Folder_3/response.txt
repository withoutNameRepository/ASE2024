def find_original_set(sets):
    original_set = set()
    for s in sets:
        original_set |= s
    return original_set
```
This function takes a list of sets `sets` as input and returns the smallest set that contains all elements from each of the given sets. The line `original_set |= s` is used to merge the current element `s` with the existing set `original_set`, so that it includes all elements from both sets.
