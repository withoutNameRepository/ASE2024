```
def find_original_set(arg1, arg2, arg3, ..., arg714):
    # initialize the original set as an empty set
    original_set = set()
    
    # loop through all arguments and add their elements to the original set
    for i in range(714):
        original_set |= args[i]
        
    return original_set
```
Note: The `|=` operator is used to update the original set with the new elements from each argument.
