    return {x for x in a | b | c}
```
Note: This function uses the set union operator (`|`) to combine the three sets into a single set, and then uses a set comprehension to extract the elements from that set. The resulting set is guaranteed to contain all of the elements of `a`, `b`, and `c`, since each element of those sets is a subset of the original set.
