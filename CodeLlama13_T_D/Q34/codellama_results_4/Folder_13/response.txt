def find_original_set(sets):
    original_set = set()
    for s in sets:
        original_set |= s
    return original_set
```
This function takes a list of sets as input and returns the smallest set that contains all the elements of the given sets. It uses the `|=` operator to combine the sets, which is equivalent to `original_set = original_set | s`. The `|` operator creates a new set containing all the elements of both sets, while `=` assigns the result back to the variable `original_set`.
