```python
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x < 0 and 0 <= x < 10]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of negative integers from the input `my_list`. The condition `x < 0 and 0 <= x < 10` checks that each element in `my_list` is less than 0, but greater than or equal to 0. This excludes any negative integers that are also greater than or equal to 10.
