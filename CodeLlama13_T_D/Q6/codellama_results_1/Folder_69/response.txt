```python
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[68:99] if x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices in `lst`, and returns only the negative integers. The `if` clause ensures that only negative numbers are included in the output.
