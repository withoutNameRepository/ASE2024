```python
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[42:87] if x < 0]
```
Here is the breakdown of the code:

* `my_list`: This is the list that we are checking.
* `[42:87]`: This is the range of indices that we want to check for negative integers.
* `x < 0`: This is a condition that checks if each element in the range is less than 0. If it is, it will be included in the resulting list.
* `return [x for x in my_list[42:87] if x < 0]`: This line returns the result of the previous code. It creates a new list with only the negative integers from the specified range.
