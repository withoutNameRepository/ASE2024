def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[86:89] if x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (86 to 89, both exclusive) and checks if each element is negative. If it is, it is included in the resulting list. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
