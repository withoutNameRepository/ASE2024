```python
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x < 0 and x >= -1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and only keeps the negative integers that are less than or equal to -1. The resulting list is returned as the output of the function.
