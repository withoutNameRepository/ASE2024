```
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[80:200] if x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of negative integers from the given list. The `x for x` part is the variable that will be used to loop over the elements of the list, and the `if x < 0` part is the condition that must be met in order for an element to be included in the resulting list.

Here's an example usage of this function:
```
my_list = [-1, -2, -3, 4, 5, -6, -7]
print(all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list)) # Output: [-1, -2, -3, -6, -7]
```
