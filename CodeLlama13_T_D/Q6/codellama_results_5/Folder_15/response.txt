```
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 0 <= x < 4 and x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, and includes only those that are negative integers between indices 0 and 3, both exclusive. If no such integer exists, an empty list is returned.
