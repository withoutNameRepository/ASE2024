```
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x < 0 and 51 <= x <= 76]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of all negative integers from index 51 to index 76, both exclusive. The `and` operator is used to check that the integer is both less than 0 and between the specified indices.
