```python
def all_neg_ints_exclusive(mylist):
    return [x for x in mylist if x < 0 and 0 <= x <= 10]
```
Explanation:

* `return` statement returns a list of elements from `mylist` that satisfy the condition.
* List comprehension is used to create a new list with all negative integers from index 0 to index 10, both exclusive.
* The condition `x < 0 and 0 <= x <= 10` checks if `x` is less than 0 and between 0 and 10 (both inclusive).
