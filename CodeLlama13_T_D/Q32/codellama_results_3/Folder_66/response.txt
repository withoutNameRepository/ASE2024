def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "k" else f"{char}k" for char in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and inserts the character 'k' immediately following any occurrences of the character 'k'. The `f-string` format is used to insert the 'k' character into the output string.
