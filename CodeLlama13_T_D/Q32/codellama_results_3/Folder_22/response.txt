```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([c + "U" if c == "U" else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and checks each character against the target character 'U'. If it is an occurrence of the target character, then it is added to the output string followed by the target character 'U'. Otherwise, it is simply copied to the output string. The resulting string is then joined back into a single string using the "".join() method.
