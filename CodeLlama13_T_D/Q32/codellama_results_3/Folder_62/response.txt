```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "o" else "o" for char in string])
```
Note: This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string and checks if each character is equal to `"o"`; if it is, then `"o"` is inserted into the output string immediately succeeding any occurrences of `" "` (a space). If the current character is not `"o"`, then it is left unchanged in the output string. Finally, the list comprehension is converted to a string using `"".join()`.
