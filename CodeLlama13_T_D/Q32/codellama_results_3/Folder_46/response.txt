```
def insert_after_character(s):
    return "".join([c + "W" if c == "6" else c for c in s])
```
This is a generator expression that loops over the string `s` and for each character `c`, checks if it is equal to `'6'`. If it is, then it adds the character `'W'` after it. Otherwise, it keeps the original character `c`. The resulting string is constructed using `"".join()` method.
