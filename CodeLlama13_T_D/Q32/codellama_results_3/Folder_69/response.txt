```python
def insert_after_character(string, char):
    return "".join([char + c if c == " " else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in `string`, and inserts `'P'` after any occurrences of `' '` (space). The resulting string is then joined using `"".join()`.
