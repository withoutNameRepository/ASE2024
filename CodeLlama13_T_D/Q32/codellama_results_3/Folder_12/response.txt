```python
def insert_after_character(s):
    return "".join(" I"[i % 2] + c for i, c in enumerate(s))
```
This function works by iterating over the characters of the input string using `enumerate`. For each character, it checks if it is `'I'` and, if so, inserts a space into the output. The rest of the characters are simply concatenated to the output using `+`.
