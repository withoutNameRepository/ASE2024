```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "4" else f"{char}0" for char in string])
```
Explanation:

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string. For each character, it checks if it is equal to `'4'`, and if so, inserts `'0'` after it using an f-string. If the character is not equal to `'4'`, it is included in the output string without modification. The resulting list is then joined into a single string using the `join()` method.
