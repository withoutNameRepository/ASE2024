```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char + "N" if char == 'm' else char for char in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, and inserts an "N" character after any occurrences of "m". The resulting list is then joined back into a single string using the "".join() method.
