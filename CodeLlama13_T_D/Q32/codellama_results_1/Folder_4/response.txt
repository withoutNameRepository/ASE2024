```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "a" else f"{char}6" for char in string])
```
For example, if the input is `"banana"`, the output should be `"b6anana"` because `'a'` becomes `'a' + '6'`. If the input is `"apple"`, the output should be `"app6le"` because `'p'` becomes `'p' + '6'`.

Note: The function assumes that the string does not contain any special characters, such as `\n` or `\t`, which could cause issues with the `join()` method.
