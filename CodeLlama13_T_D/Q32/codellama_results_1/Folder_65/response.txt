```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return ''.join([char if char != '6' else f"{char}9" for char in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and for each character, it checks if it is equal to `'6'`. If it is, then it inserts the character `'9'` after it, using the `f-string` syntax. The rest of the characters are returned as they are. Finally, the list comprehension is converted back into a string using the `''.join()` method.
