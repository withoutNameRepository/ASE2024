def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != 'a' else f"{char}a" for char in string])
```
This is a generator function that uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input `string`. If a character is not `'a'`, it is included in the output as-is. If a character is `'a'`, it is replaced with `'aa'` (the original `'a'` plus an additional `'a'`). The resulting list of characters is then joined into a string using `"".join()`.

For example, if `string = "hello"`:
```
chars = ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
output = ["".join([char if char != 'a' else f"{char}a" for char in chars])]
print(output)  # -> "hella"
```
