```python
def insert_after_character(s):
    return "".join([c if c != "a" else f"{c}0" for c in s])
```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a string argument `s`. The function returns a new string that is identical to the input except that character `'0'` has been inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of character `'a'`.

The code uses list comprehension and string formatting to generate the output. It iterates over each character in `s` and checks if it is equal to `'a'`. If so, it inserts a `'0'` into the new string using string formatting. Otherwise, it simply copies the original character from `s` to the new string.

The resulting string is then joined together using `"".join()` to produce the final output.
