```
def insert_after_character(s):
    return "".join(["wn" if c == "w" else c for c in s])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`, and inserts the character 'n' after any occurrences of the character 'w'. The resulting string is then returned.
