def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "O" else "Q" + char for char in string])
```
This is a Python function called `insert_after_character` that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string with the character 'Q' inserted immediately succeeding any occurrences of the character 'O'. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, checking if it is equal to 'O'. If it is, the character 'Q' is added to the output string. If not, the original character is kept. The list comprehension is then converted back into a string using the `join()` method.
