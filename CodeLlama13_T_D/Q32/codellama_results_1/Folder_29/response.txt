```
def insert_after_character(s):
    return "".join([c + "z" if c == "N" else c for c in s])
```
Note that this function uses list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string and build a new string with the desired modifications. The `join` method is then used to concatenate the resulting list into a single string.
