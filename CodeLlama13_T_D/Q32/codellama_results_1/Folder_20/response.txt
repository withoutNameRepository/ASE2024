```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "C" else f"C{char}" for char in string])
```
Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'insert_before_character' that takes one argument, a string, and returns a string that is identical except that character 'H' has been inserted immediately preceding any occurrences of character 'C'.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution without any explanation.
```python
def insert_before_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "C" else f"{char}H" for char in string])
```
