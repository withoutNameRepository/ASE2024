def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([c if c != "F" else f"{c}U" for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string `s`. For each character, it checks whether it is equal to `'F'`, and if so, it inserts the character `'U'` immediately succeeding it. Finally, the list comprehension is converted back into a string using the `"".join()` method.
