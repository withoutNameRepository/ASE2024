```python
def insert_after_character(s):
    return "".join([c if c != "E" else f"{c}T" for c in s])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string `s`. It checks each character and, if it is an 'E', inserts a 'T' immediately succeeding that character. The resulting list of characters is then joined back into a string using the `"".join()` method.
