```
def insert_after_character(string):
    return string.replace('a', 'A' + 'a')
```
This code defines a function called `insert_after_character` that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string that is identical to the input string, except that the character `'A'` is inserted immediately following any occurrences of the character `'a'`. The function does this by using the `replace()` method of strings in Python.
