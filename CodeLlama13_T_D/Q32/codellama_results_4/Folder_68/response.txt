```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "i" else f"{char}0" for char in string])
```
Note: This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and inserts a `0` after any occurrence of `i`. The `f-string` is used to construct the output string.
