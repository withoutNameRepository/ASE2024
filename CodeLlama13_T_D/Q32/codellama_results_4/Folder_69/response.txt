```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([f"{c}P" if c == ' ' else c for c in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and inserts a `P` character immediately after any occurrences of a space (``). The resulting string is then joined using the `join()` method.
