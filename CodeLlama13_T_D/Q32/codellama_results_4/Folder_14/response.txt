```python
def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char + " " if char == ' ' else char for char in string])
```
Note: This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and it joins them into a new string using the `str.join()` method. The `" ".join()` part is simply a shortcut for joining each character with a space following it, but only if the character is a space.
