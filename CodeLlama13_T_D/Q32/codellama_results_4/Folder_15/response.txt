def insert_after_character(string):
    return "".join([char if char != "o" else f"{char}o" for char in string])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and checks each character against the target character `'o'`. If the character is not equal to `'o'`, it is included in the output string unchanged. If the character is equal to `'o'`, then a new string is created by concatenating the original character with an additional `'o'` character. This new string is then included in the output string, resulting in an extra `'o'` inserted after each occurrence of `'o'`.
