def insert_after_character(string):
    return ''.join([char + "f" if char == "M" else char for char in string])
```
This is a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string where the character `'f'` has been inserted immediately after any occurrences of the character `'M'`. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and checks if the current character is equal to `'M'`, in which case it adds the character `'f'` before it. If the current character is not equal to `'M'`, it simply copies the character into the new string without any modification.
