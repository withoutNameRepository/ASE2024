```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 0 <= x <= 5 and x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `lst`, selecting only those that are negative integers between 0 and 5, both inclusive. The resulting list is then returned. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
