def all_neg_ints_inclusive(mylist):
    return [x for x in mylist[35:49+1] if x < 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers `mylist` as input and returns the list of negative integers from index 35 to index 49, both inclusive. The `[35:49+1]` notation is used to specify the range of indices to be included in the operation. The `< 0` condition is used to check if an integer `x` is negative. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
