Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[-28, 417, -121, -309, 464, 449, 370, -358, 227, -421]

The correct answer was:
[-28, -121, -309, -358]

But the LLM code returned:
[-28, -121, -309, -358, -421]

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
[-217, 312, 12, 448, -26, 283, -88, -105, -266, 91]
