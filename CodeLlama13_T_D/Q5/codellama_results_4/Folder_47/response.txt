```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(mylist):
    return [x for x in mylist[37:76+1] if x < 0]
```
This is a concise and efficient way to solve the problem. The list comprehension iterates over the specified range of the list, checks each element for negativity, and returns a new list containing all negative integers from the original list. If no negative integers are found, an empty list is returned.
