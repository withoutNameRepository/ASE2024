```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, nums))
```
This function uses the `filter()` built-in function with a lambda expression to filter out all negative integers in the input list and return them as a new list. The `<` comparison operator is used to check if each element is less than 0.
