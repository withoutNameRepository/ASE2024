```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 19 <= x <= 92 and x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of negative integers from the input list. The `<=` operator is used to include both endpoints of the range (19 and 92) in the search, and the `<` operator is used to exclude positive numbers from the output. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
