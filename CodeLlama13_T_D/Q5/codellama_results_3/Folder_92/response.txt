def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x < 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate through the elements of `my_list` and return a new list containing only the negative integers. The `< 0` comparison is used to check if each element is less than zero, and if it is, it is included in the output list. If no negative integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
