```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[20:31] if x < 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing only the negative integers from index 20 to index 30, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
