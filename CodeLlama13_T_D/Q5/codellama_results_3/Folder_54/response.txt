def all_neg_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return [x for x in numbers[34:56] if x < 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing all the negative integers in the specified range. The `if` clause ensures that only negative integers are included in the output, and the `[34:56]` slice specifies the indices to include in the search.
