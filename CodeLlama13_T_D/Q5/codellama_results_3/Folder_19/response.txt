```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[3:6] if x < 0]
```
This is a concise and efficient way to achieve the desired result. The list comprehension iterates over the specified range of indices, and uses a conditional expression to filter out any positive integers. The resulting list is returned.
