    return [number for number in numbers[52:71+1] if number < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and check if each number is negative. If a negative integer is found, it is included in the output list. The `numbers[52:71+1]` syntax specifies the inclusive range of indices from 52 to 71.
