```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and create a new list containing only the negative integers. The `if` clause ensures that only integers less than 0 are included in the output. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
