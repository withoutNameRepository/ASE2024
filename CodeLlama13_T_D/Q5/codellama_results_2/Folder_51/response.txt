```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if i < 0 and 1 <= abs(i) <= 8]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of negative integers from the input list. The `abs` function is used to convert each integer to its absolute value, so that it can be compared to the range 1 to 8 inclusive.
