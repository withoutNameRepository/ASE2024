```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return list(filter(lambda x: x < 0, numbers))
```
This function uses the `filter()` function to iterate over the input list and returns a new list containing only the negative integers. The `lambda` function is used as an anonymous function that takes one argument `x` and checks if it is less than 0. If the condition is true, the element is included in the output list.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is already sorted in ascending order. If the input list is not sorted, you may need to use a different approach or sort the list first before applying this function.
