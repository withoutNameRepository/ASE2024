```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 91 <= x <= 99 and x < 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the negative integers from index 91 to index 99, both inclusive. The `if` condition checks that the current element is between 91 and 99 (inclusive) and less than 0. If no such elements exist, an empty list is returned.
