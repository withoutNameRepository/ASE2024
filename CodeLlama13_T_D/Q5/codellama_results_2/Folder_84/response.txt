```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[43:87] if x < 0]
```
This code defines a function called `all_neg_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the list of all negative integers from index 43 to index 86, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
The solution uses list comprehension and slicing to achieve this. It first creates a new list by iterating over `my_list[43:87]`, which contains all elements from index 43 to index 86, both inclusive. Then it filters the elements using `if x < 0` to keep only negative integers in the list. The resulting list is returned as output of the function.
