def all_neg_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers[52:71+1] if num < 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all negative integers from the specified range (index 52 to index 71, both inclusive). If no negative integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.

Note that the `numbers[52:71+1]` syntax is used to specify the range of indices to include in the output list. The `num < 0` condition checks whether each number in the input list is negative or not, and only negative numbers are included in the output list.
