```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return [number for number in numbers[20:31] if number < 0]
```
Explanation:

* The function takes a list of integers as an argument, `numbers`.
* It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `numbers` from index 20 to index 30 (both inclusive).
* For each element, if it is less than 0, it is included in the output list.
* If no negative integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
