```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 10 <= x <= 100 and x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and returns a new list that contains all negative integers from index 10 to index 100, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
