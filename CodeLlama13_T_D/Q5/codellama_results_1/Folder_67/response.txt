```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[21:51] if x < 0]
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of negative integers from index 21 to index 50, both inclusive. The `if` condition checks if each integer is less than 0, and only those that satisfy this condition are included in the resulting list.
