```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[75:94+1] if x < 0] or []
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing only the negative integers from indices 75 to 94, both inclusive. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The function uses a list comprehension with a conditional expression to filter out non-negative integers and a short-circuiting OR operator to return an empty list if no such elements are found.
