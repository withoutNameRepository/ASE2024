```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[6:6+1] if x < 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and returns a new list containing only the negative integers in that range. The `if` clause is used to filter out non-negative numbers.
