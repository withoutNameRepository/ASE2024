```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x < 0 and 1 <= abs(x) <= 5]
```
This is a list comprehension that creates a new list with only the negative integers from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. The `abs()` function is used to ensure that the condition applies to both positive and negative integers.
