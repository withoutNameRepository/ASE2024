def all_neg_ints_inclusive(arr):
    return [x for x in arr if x < 0 and 0 <= x <= 3]
```
This is a one-line function that uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list `arr` and select elements that are negative integers between indices 0 and 3, both inclusive. The resulting list of selected elements is returned by the function.
