```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums if x < 0 and 0 <= x <= 6]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `nums` and selects only those elements that are negative integers and within the range from 0 to 6, both inclusive. The resulting list is returned as the output of the function.
