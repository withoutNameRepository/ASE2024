```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[64:67+1] if x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (64 to 66, both inclusive) and returns the list of negative integers that exist within that range. If no negative integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
