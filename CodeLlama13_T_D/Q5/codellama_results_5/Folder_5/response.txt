```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[8:10] if x < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and returns the list of negative integers found within that range. If no negative integers are found, an empty list is returned.
