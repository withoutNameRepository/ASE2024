```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x < 0 and 4 <= my_list.index(x) <= 4]
```
This code defines a function called `all_neg_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as its only argument. The function returns a list of all negative integers in the specified range, which is from index 4 to index 4 both inclusive. If no such integer exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

Note that this code uses a list comprehension to create a new list with only the negative integers in the specified range. The list comprehension iterates over the input `my_list`, and for each element `x` it checks if `x` is less than 0, and also checks if its index is within the specified range using the `index()` method of lists. If both conditions are true, the element `x` is included in the output list.
