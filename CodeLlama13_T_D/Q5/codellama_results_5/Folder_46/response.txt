```python
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[30:88] if x < 0]
```
This code uses list comprehension to extract all negative integers from the specified range of indices. The `if` clause checks whether each element is less than zero, and only those elements that meet this condition are included in the output list. If no negative integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
