```
def all_neg_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[31:72+1] if i < 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and checks if each element is negative. If it is, it is included in the output list. The `+1` after `72` is necessary because Python's slicing notation is exclusive for the end index, but we want to include the 73rd index.
