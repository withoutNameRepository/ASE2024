```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(list):
    return [i for i in range(369, 984) if i > 0 and i not in list]
```
Note: This function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of positive integers between 369 and 983 that are not in the input list. The `range` function is used to generate the range of numbers, and the `if` clause filters out negative and duplicate values.
