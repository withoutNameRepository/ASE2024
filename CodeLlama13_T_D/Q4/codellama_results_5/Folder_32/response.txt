```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 11 < x < 76 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, and returns a new list that contains only those elements that are positive integers between indices 11 and 76, both exclusive. If no such elements exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
