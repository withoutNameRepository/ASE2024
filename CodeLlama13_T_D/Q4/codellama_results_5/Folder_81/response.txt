```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums if 10 < x < 100 and isinstance(x, int)]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from the input list. The `if` condition checks that each element is an integer between 10 and 99 (exclusive), and if it meets this criteria, it is included in the output list. If no elements meet this criteria, an empty list is returned.
