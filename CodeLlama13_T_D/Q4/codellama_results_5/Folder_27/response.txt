```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 28 < x < 49 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and return only those that are positive integers between 28 and 49, both exclusive. If no such elements exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
