```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x > 64 and x < 80]
```
Explanation:

* The function takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
* The function returns a new list that contains all positive integers from index 64 to index 80, both exclusive.
* The list comprehension `[x for x in my_list if x > 64 and x < 80]` creates a new list by iterating over the elements of `my_list` and only including elements that meet the condition `x > 64 and x < 80`.
* If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
