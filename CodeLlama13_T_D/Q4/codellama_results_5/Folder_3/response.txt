```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 78 < x < 93 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to select all positive integers from the input list that are greater than 78 and less than 93, both exclusive. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
