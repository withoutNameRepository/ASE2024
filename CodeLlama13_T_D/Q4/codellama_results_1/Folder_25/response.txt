```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 41 < x <= 69 and x > 0]
```
Explanation:

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `lst`, and returns only those elements that are positive integers, and fall within the specified range of indices (41 to 69), both exclusive. If no such elements exist in the list, an empty list is returned.
