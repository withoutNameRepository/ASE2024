def all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 49 < x < 74 and x > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all positive integers from index 49 to index 74, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The list comprehension is used to filter the original list and create a new one with only the desired elements.
