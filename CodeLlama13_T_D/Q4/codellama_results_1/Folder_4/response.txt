```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 10 < x < 76 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, checking that each element is both positive (greater than 0) and within the specified range (from index 10 to index 76, both exclusive). If an element meets these criteria, it is included in the resulting list.

For example:
```python
print(all_pos_ints_exclusive([3, 5, 12, 98, 4, 23, 67]))
# Output: [12, 4, 67]
```
This function returns the list `[12, 4, 67]` because these are the only positive integers in the specified range that are also even numbers.
