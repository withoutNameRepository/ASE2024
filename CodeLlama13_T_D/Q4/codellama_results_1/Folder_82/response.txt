def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 20 < x < 200 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the positive integers from index 20 to index 200, both exclusive. It does this by iterating over each element `x` in the input list `my_list`, and checking if it is greater than 0 and between indices 20 and 200 (exclusive) using the `and` operator. If no such integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
