```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x > 42 and x < 100]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and check whether each element is between 43 and 99, both exclusive. If an element meets this condition, it is included in the output list. The returned list will contain all positive integers from index 43 to index 99, both exclusive, or an empty list if no such elements exist.
