```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 56 < x < 88 and x > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all positive integers from index 56 to index 88, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list. The key is to use a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) to filter out all elements that are not positive integers and are outside of the specified range.
