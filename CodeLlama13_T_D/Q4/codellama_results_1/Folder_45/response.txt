```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(list_of_ints):
    return [x for x in list_of_ints if 30 < x < 200 and x > 0]
```
Explanation:

This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of all positive integers from the input list that are greater than 30 and less than 200. The `x for x in list_of_ints` part creates a new list with each element being `x`. The `if 30 < x < 200 and x > 0` part filters out any elements that do not meet the criteria of being positive integers between 30 and 200, inclusive.

Note: You can also use the built-in `range()` function to create a range of numbers as follows:
```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(list_of_ints):
    return [x for x in list_of_ints if 30 < x < 200 and x > 0]
```
