```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[6:9] if x > 0]
```
This is a concise and efficient way to solve the problem, using list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from indices 6 to 9, both exclusive. The `if x > 0` clause ensures that only positive integers are included in the output list.
