```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 38 < x < 81 and x > 0]
```
The above function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `my_list`, and returns only those elements that are both positive integers and fall within the specified range of indices (exclusive). If no such element is found, an empty list is returned.
