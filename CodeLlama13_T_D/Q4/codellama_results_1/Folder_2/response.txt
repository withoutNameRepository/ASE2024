```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 36 < x <= 52 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from the input list. The `if` clause filters out any values that are not between 36 and 52, inclusive, or that are not positive.
