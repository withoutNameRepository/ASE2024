```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x > 60 and x < 200]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a new list containing only the positive integers that are between indices 60 (exclusive) and 200 (exclusive). If no positive integers exist in this range, the function returns an empty list.
