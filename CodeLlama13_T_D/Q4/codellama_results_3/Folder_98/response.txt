```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in range(1, 7) if x in my_list and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range of positive integers from 1 to 6, inclusive. It then checks if each integer is present in the input list `my_list` and greater than 0 using the `in` and `>` operators respectively. If both conditions are met, the integer is included in the output list, otherwise it is not. The final list is returned.

For example:
```
>>> all_pos_ints_exclusive([1, 2, 3])
[2, 3]

>>> all_pos_ints_exclusive([-1, -2, -3])
[]

>>> all_pos_ints_exclusive([5, 6, 7])
[6]
```
