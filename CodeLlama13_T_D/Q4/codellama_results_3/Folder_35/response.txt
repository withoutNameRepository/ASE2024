```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 10 < x < 79 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from the input `my_list` that are greater than 10 and less than 79, both exclusive. The `x % 2 == 1` condition ensures that only odd numbers are included in the output list.
