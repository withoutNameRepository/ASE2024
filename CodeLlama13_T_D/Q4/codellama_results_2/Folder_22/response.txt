```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 40 < x < 200 and x > 0]
```
Explanation:

This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `my_list` and returns all positive integers that are greater than 40 and less than 200. The `and` operator is used to ensure that the integer is both positive and in the specified range. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

For example:
```python
my_list = [-1, -5, 4, 32, 89, 100]
print(all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list)) # Output: [4, 32, 89]
```
