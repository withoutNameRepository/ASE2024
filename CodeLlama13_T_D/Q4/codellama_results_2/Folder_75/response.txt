```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(numbers):
    return [number for number in numbers if 20 < number <= 36 and number > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the `numbers` list, keeping only the elements that are between index 20 (inclusive) and index 36 (exclusive), and greater than 0. The resulting list is then returned.
