```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if i > 65 and i < 91]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a new list that contains only the positive integers from index 66 to index 90 (both exclusive). If no positive integers exist in this range, the function returns an empty list.

Here is an example of how to use this function:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list)) # Output: [7, 8, 9]

my_list = [-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6]
print(all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list)) # Output: []
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list is a list of integers. If the input list contains other data types, the function may not work as expected.
