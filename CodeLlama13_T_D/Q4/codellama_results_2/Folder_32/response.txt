```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 10 < x < 76 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `lst` and returns a new list containing only those elements that are both positive integers and have an odd index. The range is specified by the conditions in the list comprehension: `10 < x < 76` and `x % 2 == 1`. If no such elements exist, the function returns an empty list.
