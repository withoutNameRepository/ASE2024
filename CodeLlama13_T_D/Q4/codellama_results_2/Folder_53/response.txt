```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in range(100, 200) if x > 0 and x not in lst]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of positive integers from the specified range that are not already present in the input list. The `range()` function is used to generate the sequence of integers from 100 to 200, and the `if` clause filters out any negative or zero values and ensures that only positive integers are included in the output.
