def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 15 < x < 100 and x % 2 == 1]
```
Note: This function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of positive integers from index 15 to index 99, both exclusive. The `and` operator is used to ensure that each integer in the list is also odd.
