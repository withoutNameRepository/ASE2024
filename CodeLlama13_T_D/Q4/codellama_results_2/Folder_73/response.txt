```
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if 36 < i < 85 and i > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing only the positive integers from index 36 to index 85, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The implementation uses a list comprehension with a conditional expression to filter out non-positive integers.
