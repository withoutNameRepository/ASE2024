```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 70 < x < 200 and x > 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to generate a new list containing only the positive integers from index 70 to index 200, both exclusive. It first checks if `x` is greater than 0 using an inline if statement, then checks if it falls between indices 70 and 200 using chained comparison operators.

Here's an example usage:
```python
>>> lst = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst)
[2, 3, 4]
```
