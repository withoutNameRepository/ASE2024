def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 86 < x < 90 and x > 0]
```
Note: This function uses a list comprehension to filter the elements of `my_list` that are positive integers between index 86 and index 89, both exclusive. The resulting list is returned. If no such element exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
