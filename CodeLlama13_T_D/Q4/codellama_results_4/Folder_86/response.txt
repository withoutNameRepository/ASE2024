```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x > 18 and x < 60]
```
This is a single-line list comprehension that uses the `if` clause to filter out any negative or zero values from the input list, and returns only those values that are greater than 18 and less than 60. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.

For example, if we pass a list of integers `my_list = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output of the function would be `[3, 4, 5]`.
