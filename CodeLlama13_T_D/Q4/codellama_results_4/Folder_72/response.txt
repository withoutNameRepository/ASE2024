```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x > 56 and x < 88 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a new list containing all positive integers that are greater than 56 and less than 88, both exclusive. The `x for x in my_list` part creates a generator expression that iterates over the elements of the input list. The `if x > 56 and x < 88 and x % 2 == 0` part filters out any element that does not meet the specified conditions (i.e., is not positive, greater than 56, less than 88, or even). The resulting filtered list is then returned as a new list.
