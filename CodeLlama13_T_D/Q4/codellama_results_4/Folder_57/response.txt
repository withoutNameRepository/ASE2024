def all_pos_ints_exclusive(numbers):
    return [n for n in numbers if 18 < n < 37 and n > 0]
```
Please note that this function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of positive integers between 18 and 37, excluding index 18 and 37 themselves. The `and` operator is used to check if the number is greater than zero as well.
