```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(lst):
    return [i for i in range(86, 91) if i in lst and i > 0]
```
Here is the explanation of the code:

* The function `all_pos_ints_exclusive` takes one argument `lst`, which is a list of integers.
* The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range of indices from 86 to 90, both exclusive.
* The condition `if i in lst and i > 0` checks that each integer `i` is within the specified range and is positive (greater than zero). If this condition is true, the integer `i` is included in the output list.
* Finally, the function returns the list of all positive integers from index 86 to index 90, both exclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
