def all_pos_ints_exclusive(numbers):
    return [number for number in numbers if 28 < number <= 49 and number > 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over the input `numbers` list, checks whether each element is a positive integer between 28 and 49 (both exclusive), and returns a new list containing only those elements. If no such elements are found, an empty list is returned.
