```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in range(0, 5) if i in my_list and i > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices from 0 to 4, and checks whether each index is a positive integer and exists in the input list. The resulting list of positive integers is returned. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
