```python
def all_pos_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 44 < x < 67 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from the specified range, using the syntax `x for x in my_list if condition`. The `condition` is defined as `44 < x < 67 and x > 0`, which means that `x` must be greater than both 44 and 67, and also greater than zero. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
