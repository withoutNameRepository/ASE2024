```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[20:201] if x % -20 == 0 and x % -200 == 0] or []
```

This function takes a list as an argument and returns the list of integers that are divisible by both -20 and -200, from index 20 to index 200 (both inclusive). If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.

The code uses a list comprehension with two conditions `x % -20 == 0` and `x % -200 == 0`, which are combined using the logical operator `and`. The `or []` at the end of the expression is used to return an empty list if no such integers exist in the specified range.
