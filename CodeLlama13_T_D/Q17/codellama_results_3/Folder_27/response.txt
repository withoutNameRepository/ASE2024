```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[20:36] if x % -36 == 0 and x % -89 == 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list of all integers in the specified range that are divisible by both `-36` and `-89`. The `x % n == 0` condition checks if `x` is divisible by `n`, and the `and` operator combines these two conditions.
