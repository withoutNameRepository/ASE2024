```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[1:8+1] if x % -9 == 0 and x % -3 == 0]
```
This is one possible solution to the problem. The function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the elements from index 1 to index 8 (both inclusive) that are divisible by both -9 and -3. If no such element exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Note that the function uses a list comprehension to create the new list, and checks whether each element `x` in the input list is divisible by both -9 and -3 using the modulo operator (`%`).
