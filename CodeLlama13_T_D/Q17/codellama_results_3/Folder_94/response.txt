```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):
    return [number for number in numbers[93:94+1] if number % -53 == 0 and number % -91 == 0]
```
This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as input. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (from index 93 to index 94, both inclusive), and returns all integers in the list that are divisible by both -53 and -91. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Here's an example usage:
```python
numbers = [-53, -91, 20, 30, 40]
print(all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers)) # Output: [20, 30, 40]
```
