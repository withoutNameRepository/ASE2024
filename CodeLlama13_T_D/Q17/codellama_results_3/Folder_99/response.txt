```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[154:798+1] if x % 275 == 0 and x % 580 == 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are divisible by both 275 and 580, based on the input list. The `if` clause filters out any elements in the list that are not divisible by either number. The `[154:798+1]` slice notation specifies the range of indices to include in the output list.
