```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(mylist):
    result = []
    for i in range(50, 201):
        if mylist[i] % -34 == 0 and mylist[i] % 64 == 0:
            result.append(mylist[i])
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -34 and 64 from index 50 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list. The code uses a for loop to iterate over the indices between 50 and 200, and checks if each integer is divisible by -34 and 64 using the modulo operator (%). If both conditions are met, the current integer is appended to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list.
