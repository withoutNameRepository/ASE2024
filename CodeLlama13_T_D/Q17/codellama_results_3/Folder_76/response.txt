```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[250:630] if x % 850 == 0 and x % 587 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of all the integers divisible by both 850 and 587 from index 250 to index 629, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
