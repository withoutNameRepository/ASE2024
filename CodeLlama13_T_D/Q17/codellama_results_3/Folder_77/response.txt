def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[828:933] if x % -649 == 0 and x % -461 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and returns only those integers that are divisible by both `-649` and `-461`. If no such integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
