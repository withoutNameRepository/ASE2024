```
This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a single argument, `my_list`, which is assumed to be a list of integers. The function returns a new list containing all the elements of `my_list` that are divisible by both -863 and -329, from index 138 to index 424 (both inclusive). If no such elements exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

Note: The `%` operator is used to determine if a number is divisible by another number. For example, `x % -863 == 0` means that `x` is divisible by `-863`. Similarly, `x % -329 == 0` means that `x` is divisible by `-329`.
