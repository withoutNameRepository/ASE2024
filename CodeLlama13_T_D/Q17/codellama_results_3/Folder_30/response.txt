def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[11:76+1] if x % -81 == 0 and x % -94 == 0]
```
This function first slices the list to get the range from index 11 to index 76, both inclusive. Then it uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the elements of the original list that are divisible by both -81 and -94. The resulting list is then returned. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
