```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[70:201] if x % 3 == 0 and x % -300 == 0]
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of integers divisible by both 3 and -300, and it only includes elements from index 70 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
