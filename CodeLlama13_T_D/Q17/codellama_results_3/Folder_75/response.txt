```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(list_of_ints):
    return [i for i in list_of_ints[20:94] if i % -92 == 0 and i % -50 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and returns only those integers that are divisible by both -92 and -50. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
