```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[57:86] if x % -77 == 0 and x % -32 == 0]
```
This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the list of all integers divisible by both `-77` and `-32`, from index 57 to index 85, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `lst[57:86]`, and filters out the elements that are not divisible by `-77` or `-32`. The resulting list is then returned.
