```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(arr):
    return [i for i in arr[28:97] if i % 90 == 0 and i % 97 == 0]
```
Note that this solution uses a list comprehension to create the new list of integers, which is returned by the function. The `if` clause inside the list comprehension checks whether each integer in the specified range is divisible by both 90 and 97. If an integer is not divisible by both numbers, it is not included in the new list.
