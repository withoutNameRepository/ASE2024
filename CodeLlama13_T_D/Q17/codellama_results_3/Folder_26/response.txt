def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[69:71] if i % 72 == 0 and i % 70 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (from index 69 to index 70, both inclusive) and returns a new list containing only those integers that are divisible by both 72 and 70. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
