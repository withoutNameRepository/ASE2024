```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[41:57] if x % 82 == 0 and x % 90 == 0]
```
Note that this function uses list comprehension to generate the output list, which contains all integers from index 41 to index 56 (both inclusive) in `my_list` that are divisible by both 82 and 90. If no such integer exists, the function returns an empty list.
