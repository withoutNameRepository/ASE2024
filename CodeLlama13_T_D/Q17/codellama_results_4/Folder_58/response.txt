```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[240:901+1] if i % 546 == 0 and i % 709 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers that are divisible by both 546 and 709. The resulting list is created using list comprehension, where each element `i` in the original list `my_list[240:901+1]` is tested for divisibility by 546 and 709, and if it is both divisible, it is included in the resulting list. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
