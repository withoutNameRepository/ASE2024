This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as input. The function uses a for-loop to iterate over the elements of the list, and checks if each element is divisible by both -3 and 8 using the modulo operator (`%`). If an element is divisible by both numbers, it is added to the result list. Finally, the function returns the result list, which may be empty if no such integers exist in the specified range.

Note that the function uses the `range` function to iterate over the indices of the list, and accesses each element using its index. The range function is used to specify the start and end indices of the iteration, and the step size (in this case, 1).
