```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[13:92] if x % -65 == 0 and x % -62 == 0]
```
Note that the `if` condition is using the modulo operator to check whether the integer is divisible by both `-65` and `-62`. The `[]` notation is used to create a new list containing only the elements from `my_list[13:92]` that satisfy this condition.
