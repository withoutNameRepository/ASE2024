def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[200:201] if x % 17 == 0 and x % -5 == 0]
```
This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as its argument. The function returns a new list containing all the elements of the input list that are divisible by both 17 and -5, from index 200 to index 200 inclusive. If no such element exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

Note that the triple backticks at the beginning and end of the code block delimit the code only, without adding any comments. Also note that this solution uses a list comprehension to generate the output list, which is more efficient than using a for loop and appending elements to the list one by one.
