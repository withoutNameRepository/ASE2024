def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[7:10] if x % -9 == 0 and x % -7 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of all integers that are divisible by both -9 and -7 from index 7 to index 9, both inclusive. The `%` operator is used to check if each integer is divisible by -9 or -7, and the `and` operator is used to check if it is divisible by both. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
