```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(arr):
    return [x for x in arr[2:8] if x % -1 == 0 and x % -7 == 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices in the input array, and returns only those integers that are divisible by both -1 and -7. The returned list is empty if no such integers exist in the specified range.
