```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    res = []
    for i in range(48, 77):
        if lst[i] % -46 == 0 and lst[i] % -82 == 0:
            res.append(lst[i])
    return res
```
Please note that the function name is not compliant with the PEP-8 naming conventions, but this is a minor issue. The main point of this code is to demonstrate how to use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if an integer is divisible by two numbers.
