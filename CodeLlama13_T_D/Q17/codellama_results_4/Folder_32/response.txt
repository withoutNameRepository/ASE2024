```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[25:96] if x % 51 == 0 and x % 77 == 0]
```
Note that this code uses a list comprehension to generate the list of all integers divisible by both 51 and 77 from index 25 to index 95, both inclusive. The condition `x % 51 == 0` checks if an integer is divisible by 51, and the condition `x % 77 == 0` checks if it is also divisible by 77. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
