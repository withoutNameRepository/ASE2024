```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[306:957+1] if x % 982 == 0 and x % 319 == 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and returns only the elements that are divisible by both 982 and 319. If no such elements exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
