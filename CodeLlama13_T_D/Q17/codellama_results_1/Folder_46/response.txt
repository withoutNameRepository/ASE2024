def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[10:47] if x % 55 == 0 and x % 36 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and checks whether each integer is divisible by both 55 and 36. If it is, it is added to the output list; otherwise, it is not included in the output. The final output list is returned.
