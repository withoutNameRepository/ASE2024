```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of integers divisible by both `-92` and `-50`. The `x for x in my_list[20:94]` part of the list comprehension iterates over the list `my_list`, starting from index 20 (inclusive) and ending at index 93 (exclusive). The `if x % -92 == 0 and x % -50 == 0` part of the list comprehension filters out any integers that are not divisible by both `-92` and `-50`.
