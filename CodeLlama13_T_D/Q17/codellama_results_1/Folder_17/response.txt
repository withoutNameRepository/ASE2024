```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[81:90] if x % 56 == 0 and x % 68 == 0]
```
Note that the function uses a list comprehension to filter the elements of `my_list` between indices 81 and 90, inclusive, such that they are both divisible by 56 and 68. If no such integers exist in this range, an empty list is returned.
