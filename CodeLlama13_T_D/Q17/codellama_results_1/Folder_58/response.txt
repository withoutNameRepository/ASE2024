This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It uses a list comprehension to create a new list of all the integers in the specified range (from index 240 to index 901, both inclusive) that are divisible by both 546 and 709. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
