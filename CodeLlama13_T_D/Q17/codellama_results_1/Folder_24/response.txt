def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(arr):
    return [x for x in arr[29:54] if x % -68 == 0 and x % -85 == 0]
```
This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices in the input list, and returns the list of integers that are divisible by both -68 and -85. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
