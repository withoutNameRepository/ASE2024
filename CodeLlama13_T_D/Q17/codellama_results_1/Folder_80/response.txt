def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):
    return [x for x in numbers[14:93+1] if x % 71 == 0 and x % 81 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 71 and 81 from index 14 to index 93, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the relevant portion of the input list and return only the elements that are divisible by both 71 and 81.
