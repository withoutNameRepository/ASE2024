```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[90:201] if x % -31 == 0 and x % 13 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -31 and 13 from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list. The solution uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements that are divisible by both -31 and 13, and return them as a new list.
