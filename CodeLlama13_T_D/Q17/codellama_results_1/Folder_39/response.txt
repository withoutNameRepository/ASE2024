```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[13:76+1] if x % -66 == 0 and x % -32 == 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and returns only the elements that are divisible by both `-66` and `-32`. The `+1` in the slice notation is necessary because Python includes the stop index in the slice, but we need to exclude it. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
