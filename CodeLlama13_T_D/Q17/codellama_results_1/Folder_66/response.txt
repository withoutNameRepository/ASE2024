def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(list_of_ints):
    return [i for i in list_of_ints[58:81+1] if i % 55 == 0 and i % 10 == 0]
```
Note that the range is specified by the `slice` object, which includes both ends of the range. The condition checks if the current element is divisible by both 55 and 10 using the modulo operator `%`. If the condition is true, the element is included in the list.
