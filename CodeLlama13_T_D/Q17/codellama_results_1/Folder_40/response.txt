```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 0 and x % 1 == 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the input `my_list` and returns a new list containing all integers that are divisible by both 2 and 1. The `if` clause in the comprehension ensures that only integers that meet this condition are included in the output list. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
