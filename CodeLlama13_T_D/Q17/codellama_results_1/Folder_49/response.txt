```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[80:201] if x % 10 == 0 and x % 1000 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both 10 and 1000 from index 80 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
