```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[69:71] if i % 70 == 0 and i % 72 == 0]
```
Note that this solution uses list comprehension to generate a new list of integers divisible by both 72 and 70, and the `if` condition checks whether each integer is divisible by both numbers. The function returns an empty list if no such integers exist in the specified range.
