def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[34:70] if x % 19 == 0 and x % 32 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a list of all integers divisible by both 19 and 32 from index 34 to index 69, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
