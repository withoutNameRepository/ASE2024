```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):
    return [x for x in numbers[50:201] if x % -34 == 0 and x % 64 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter the input list `numbers` to only include integers that are divisible by both -34 and 64, between indices 50 and 200 inclusive. The resulting list is returned if there are any such integers in the specified range, or an empty list otherwise.
