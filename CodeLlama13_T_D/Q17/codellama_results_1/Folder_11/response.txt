```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):
    return [x for x in numbers[22:24+1] if x % -85 == 0 and x % -30 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -85 and -30 from index 22 to index 24, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
