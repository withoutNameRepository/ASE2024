This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as input. It then returns a new list containing all the elements from index 13 to index 18 (both inclusive) in the original list that are divisible by both 45 and 20. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
