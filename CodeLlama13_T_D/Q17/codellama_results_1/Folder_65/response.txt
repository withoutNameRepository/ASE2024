def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[50:93] if x % -94 == 0 and x % -95 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of all integers divisible by both -94 and -95 from index 50 to index 92, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
