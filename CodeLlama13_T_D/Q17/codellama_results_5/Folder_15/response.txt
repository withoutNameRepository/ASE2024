def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(3):
        if my_list[i] % -2 == 0 and my_list[i] % 3 == 0:
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
Note that this function only works for the specified range of indices (from 0 to 2, both inclusive). If you need to find all integers divisible by both -2 and 3 in a larger range of indices, you will need to modify the function accordingly.
