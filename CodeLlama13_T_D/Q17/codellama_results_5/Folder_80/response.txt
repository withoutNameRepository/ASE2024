```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(numbers):
    return [x for x in numbers[14:93+1] if x % 71 == 0 and x % 81 == 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate through the specified range of indices, and checks whether each integer is divisible by both 71 and 81. If it is, it is included in the output list; otherwise, it is not.
