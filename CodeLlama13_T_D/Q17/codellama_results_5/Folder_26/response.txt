```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[69:71] if x % 70 == 0 and x % 72 == 0]
```
Note that the function uses list slicing to get a sub-list of the input list starting from index 69 (inclusive) and ending at index 70 (exclusive), then it filters this sub-list using list comprehension to keep only the integers divisible by both 70 and 72. If no such integer is found, an empty list is returned.

Here is another solution:
```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 70 == 0 and x % 72 == 0]
```
This function uses the same logic as the previous one, but it does not use list slicing to get a sub-list of the input list. Instead, it filters the entire list using list comprehension.
