```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[40:201] if x % 21 == 0 and x % 71 == 0]
```
This code uses list comprehension to create a new list of all integers divisible by both 21 and 71 from the given range. The `if` clause is used to check whether each integer in the range is divisible by both numbers. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
