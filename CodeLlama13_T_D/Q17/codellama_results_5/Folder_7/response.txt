```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[543:585] if x % -553 == 0 and x % -737 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, returning only those elements that are divisible by both `-553` and `-737`. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
