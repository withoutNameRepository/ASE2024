```
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[56:89] if x % -59 == 0 and x % -79 == 0]
```
This is a concise and efficient solution that uses list comprehension to iterate through the specified range of the input list, filtering out any integers that are not divisible by both -59 and -79. The resulting list of integers is then returned.
