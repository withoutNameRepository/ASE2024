This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes one argument, an integer list. The function returns a list of integers divisible by both -40 and -12 from index 10 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of integers that are divisible by both -40 and -12. The `x % -40 == 0 and x % -12 == 0` condition checks if each integer in the list is divisible by both numbers. If it is, it is included in the output list.

The function also uses slicing to get a range of indices from the input list. The slice `[10:76+1]` selects the elements at indices 10 through 76, both inclusive.
