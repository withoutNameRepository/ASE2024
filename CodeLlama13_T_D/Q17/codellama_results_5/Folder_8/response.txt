```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(mylist):
    result = []
    for i in range(36, 85+1):
        if mylist[i] % -27 == 0 and mylist[i] % -96 == 0:
            result.append(mylist[i])
    return result
```
Here is the same function with comments added:
```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(mylist):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through the specified range of indices in the input list
    for i in range(36, 85+1):
        
        # Check if the current integer is divisible by both -27 and -96
        if mylist[i] % -27 == 0 and mylist[i] % -96 == 0:
            
            # If it is, add it to the results list
            result.append(mylist[i])
    
    # Return the results list
    return result
```
Note that this function assumes that the input list contains at least 36 elements (from index 0 to index 85, both inclusive), and that all of these elements are integers. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code or handle the edge cases differently.
