```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[8:10] if x % -3 == 0 and x % 6 == 0] or []
```
Note: This solution uses list comprehension to generate the list of all integers divisible by both -3 and 6 from index 8 to index 9, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
