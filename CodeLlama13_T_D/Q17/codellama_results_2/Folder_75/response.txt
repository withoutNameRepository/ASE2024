def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    return [i for i in lst[20:94] if i % -92 == 0 and i % -50 == 0]
```
Note that the list slicing syntax `[20:94]` is used to specify the range of indices to check, and the conditional expression `i % -92 == 0 and i % -50 == 0` is used to filter out only those integers divisible by both `-92` and `-50`. The resulting list is returned.
