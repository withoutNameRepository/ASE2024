```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[10:101] if x % 10 == 0 and x % 100 == 0]
```
This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as its argument. The function returns a new list containing all the elements from the input list that are divisible by both 10 and 100, between indices 10 and 100 inclusive. If no such element is found, an empty list is returned.

The code uses a list comprehension to create the new list. The `x for x in my_list[10:101]` part iterates over the elements of the input list between indices 10 and 100 inclusive, and the `if` clause filters out any element that is not divisible by both 10 and 100.
