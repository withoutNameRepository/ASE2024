```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[81:87] if x % -33 == 0 and x % -62 == 0]
```
This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, checking whether each integer is divisible by both `-33` and `-62`. If an integer is divisible by both, it is included in the output list. The `if x % -33 == 0 and x % -62 == 0` check ensures that only integers divisible by both are included in the output list.
