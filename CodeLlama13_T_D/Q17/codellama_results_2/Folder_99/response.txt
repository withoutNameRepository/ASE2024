This function takes a list of integers as input `arr` and returns a list of all integers that are divisible by both 275 and 580, from index 154 to index 798, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Note: This function assumes that the input `arr` is a valid list of integers.
