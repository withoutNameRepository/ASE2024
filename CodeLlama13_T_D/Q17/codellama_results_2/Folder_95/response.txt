```python
def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(lst):
    return [i for i in lst[57:84+1] if i % -30 == 0 and i % -88 == 0]
```
This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums` that takes a list of integers as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements in the list from index 57 to 84 (inclusive), and returns the list of all elements that are divisible by both -30 and -88. If no such elements exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
