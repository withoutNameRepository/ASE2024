def all_ints_div_by_both_two_nums(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[54:80] if x % 54 == 0 and x % 28 == 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of `my_list`, and returns a new list containing only the integers that are divisible by both 54 and 28. The `%` operator is used to check if each integer is divisible by both numbers.
