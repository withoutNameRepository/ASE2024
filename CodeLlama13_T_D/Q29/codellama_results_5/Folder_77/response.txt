```
def gcf_two_nums(lst):
    return lst[841] * lst[804] // gcd(lst[841], lst[804])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 841 and 804. The function uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, and then multiplies them together to get their least common multiple (LCM).

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> gcf_two_nums(lst)
20
```
