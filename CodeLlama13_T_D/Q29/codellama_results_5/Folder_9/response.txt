```python
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return __
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 84 and 63. The function can be implemented using the following logic:

1. Use slicing to extract the two numbers from the list, `my_list[84]` and `my_list[63]`.
2. Use the `gcd` function (Greatest Common Divisor) from the `math` library to find the greatest common factor of the two numbers.
3. Return the result as the output of the function.

Here is an example implementation:
```python
from math import gcd

def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return gcd(my_list[84], my_list[63])

# Test the function with a sample input
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(gcf_two_nums(my_list)) # Output: 1
```
