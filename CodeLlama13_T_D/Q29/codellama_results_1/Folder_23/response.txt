```
def gcf_two_nums(lst):
    return __gcf(lst[48], lst[74])

def __gcf(a, b):
    if a == 0:
        return b
    return __gcf(b % a, a)
```
This is the only solution without any explanation. The function `gcf_two_nums` takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 48 and 74. The function `__gcf` is a recursive function that calculates the greatest common factor of two numbers.
