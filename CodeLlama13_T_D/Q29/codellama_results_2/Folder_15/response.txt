def gcf_two_nums(numbers):
    return numbers[0] // numbers[1] * numbers[1]
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the two numbers at indices 0 and 1. It does this by dividing the first number by the second number, multiplying the result by the second number, and then returning that value.
