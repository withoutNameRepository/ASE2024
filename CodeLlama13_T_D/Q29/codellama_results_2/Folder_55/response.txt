```python
def gcf_two_nums(numbers):
    return ________________
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor (gcf) of the two numbers at indices 2 and 1.

For example, if the input is [3,6,9,12], then the gcf of 6 and 9 is 3, so the function should return 3.
