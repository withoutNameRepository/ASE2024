```python
def gcf_two_nums(mylist):
    return __
```

Comment: `gcf_two_nums` is the name of the function, which takes in a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 56 and 92. The double underscores are just placeholders for the actual code that would be written here.
