```
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return my_list[42]*my_list[25] // gcd(my_list[42], my_list[25])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers `my_list` as input and returns the greatest common factor (gcf) of the integers at indices 42 and 25. It does this by multiplying the two numbers together, dividing them by their greatest common divisor (gcd), and returning the result.

For example, if `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, then `gcf_two_nums(my_list)` would return `120` because `120 = 4*5*6*7*8/2`.
