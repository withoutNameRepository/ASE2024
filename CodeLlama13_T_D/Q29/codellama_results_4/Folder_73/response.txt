```python
def gcf_two_nums(list_of_ints):
    return list_of_ints[51] // gcd(list_of_ints[51], list_of_ints[27]) * list_of_ints[27]
```
This function takes a single argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 51 and 27. The function uses the `gcd` function from the Python standard library to compute the greatest common divisor of the two numbers, and then multiplies the result by the smaller number to obtain the greatest common factor.
