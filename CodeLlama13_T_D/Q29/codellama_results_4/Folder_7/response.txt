def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return my_list[224] * my_list[663] // math.gcd(my_list[224], my_list[663])
```
Explanation: The `math.gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers, which is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. By multiplying the two numbers and then dividing by their GCD, we get the greatest common factor of the two numbers.
