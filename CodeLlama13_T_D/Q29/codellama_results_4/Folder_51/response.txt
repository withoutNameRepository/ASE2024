def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return my_list[46]*my_list[84] // math.gcd(my_list[46], my_list[84])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 46 and 84. It uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, and then multiplies the two numbers together to get their least common multiple.
