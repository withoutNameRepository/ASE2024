def gcf_two_nums(positive_integers):
    return positive_integers[51] * positive_integers[31] // gcd(positive_integers[51], positive_integers[31])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 51 and 31. It uses the built-in `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is then used to find the GCF by multiplying the two numbers together and dividing by their GCD.
