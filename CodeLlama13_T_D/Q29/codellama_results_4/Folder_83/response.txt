```python
def gcf_two_nums(numbers):
    return __
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the numbers at indices 17 and 20. To do this, we can use the `gcd` function from the `math` library to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers, and then repeatedly apply it to the numbers until we reach a single number that is a common divisor for both.
```python
from math import gcd

def gcf_two_nums(numbers):
    return gcd(numbers[17], numbers[20])
```
