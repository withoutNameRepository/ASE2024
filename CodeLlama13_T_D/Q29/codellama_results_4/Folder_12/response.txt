def gcf_two_nums(numbers):
    return ________________
```
This is a function definition that takes in a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the greatest common factor of the integers at indices 56 and 54. The function uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is then used to find the GCF.

The function first checks if the input list is empty or not, and if it is empty, it returns 0 as the GCF. If the list is not empty, the function calculates the GCD of the integers at indices 56 and 54 using the `gcd` function, and then uses the `lcm` function from the `math` module to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers. Finally, the function returns the LCM as the GCF.

Note that this solution assumes that the indices 56 and 54 are valid for the input list, and if they are not valid, the function may raise an `IndexError`.
