```python
def gcf_two_nums(my_list):
    return my_list[85] * my_list[33] // math.gcd(my_list[85], my_list[33])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the two numbers at indices 85 and 33, respectively. It uses the `math.gcd` function to compute the greatest common divisor of the two numbers, and then multiplies them together to get their least common multiple.
