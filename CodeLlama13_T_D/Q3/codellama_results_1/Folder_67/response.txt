```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 22 <= x <= 50 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, and returns a new list containing only those elements that are positive integers between 22 and 50, both inclusive. If no such element exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
