```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 82 <= x <= 86 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, and returns only those elements that are both positive integers between indices 82 and 86, inclusive. The `and` operator is used to check that each element is greater than zero in addition to being between the specified indices.
