```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(arr):
    return [x for x in arr if 6 <= x <= 6 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `arr`, and returns only the elements that are positive integers between 6 and 6, both inclusive. If no such element exists, an empty list is returned.
