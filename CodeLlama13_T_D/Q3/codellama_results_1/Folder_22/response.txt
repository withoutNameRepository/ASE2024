```
This is a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all positive integers from the specified range. The `range` function is used to generate the range of numbers, and the `if` statement checks whether each number in the range is both positive and present in the original list. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
