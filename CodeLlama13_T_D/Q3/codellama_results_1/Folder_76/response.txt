```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return list(filter(lambda x: 686 <= x <= 987, my_list))
```
This function uses the `filter()` function to filter out any elements that are not between indices 686 and 987 (both inclusive), and then returns a new list containing only those elements. If there are no positive integers in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
