```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [i for i in range(56, 83) if i in lst and i > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range of positive integers from 56 to 82, both inclusive. It checks if each integer is in the input list `lst` and greater than 0, and returns a new list containing only those elements that meet these criteria. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
