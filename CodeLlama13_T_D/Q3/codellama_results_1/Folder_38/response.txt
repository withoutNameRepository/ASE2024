```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 22 <= x <= 63 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `my_list`, and returns a new list of all positive integers that are between indices 22 and 63, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in this range, an empty list is returned.
