```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 23 <= x <= 23 and x > 0]
```
Here's a breakdown of the code:

* `def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list)`: This defines a function called `all_pos_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, `my_list`.
* `[x for x in my_list if 23 <= x <= 23 and x > 0]`: This is a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) that creates a new list containing all elements `x` from the input list `my_list` such that `23 <= x <= 23 and x > 0`.
* `23 <= x <= 23`: This is a condition that checks if `x` is between `23` and `23`, both inclusive.
* `x > 0`: This is an additional condition that checks if `x` is positive.

This function will return an empty list if no positive integers exist in the specified range, or a list of all positive integers from index `23` to index `23`, both inclusive, otherwise.
