```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return list(filter(lambda x: 75 <= x <= 88, my_list))
```
Explanation: The `filter()` function is used to filter the elements of the list that satisfy the condition. The lambda function checks if each element is between 75 and 88 inclusive using the `<=` operator. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
