```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 527 <= x <= 538 and x > 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list and returns a new list of positive integers between indices 527 and 538 (both inclusive). If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
