def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 82 <= x <= 86 and x > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of positive integers from index 82 to index 86, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list. The function uses a list comprehension with a filter condition to select only the positive integers that fall within the specified range.
