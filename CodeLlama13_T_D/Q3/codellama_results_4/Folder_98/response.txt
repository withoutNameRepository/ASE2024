```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in range(0, 7) if x in my_list]
```
This is a solution using list comprehension. It generates the list of positive integers from index 0 to index 6 both inclusive and checks if each element exists in the input list. If not, it excludes that integer from the output list.
