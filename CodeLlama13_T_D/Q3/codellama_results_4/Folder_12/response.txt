```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 14 <= x <= 64 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and select only the positive integers between 14 and 64, both inclusive. The resulting list is returned as-is if there are any positive integers in this range, or an empty list is returned if no such integers exist.
