def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 527 <= x <= 538 and x > 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate through the input list `my_list` and returns a new list of positive integers that are within the specified range of indices 527 to 538, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
