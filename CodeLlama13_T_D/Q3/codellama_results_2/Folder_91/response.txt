def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 0 <= x <= 5 and x > 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that creates a new list with only the positive integers from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. The `if` clause ensures that only positive integers are included in the list.
