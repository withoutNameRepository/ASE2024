```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [num for num in nums[4:9] if num > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the slice of `nums` from index 4 to index 8, both inclusive. It filters out any negative integers and returns the remaining positive integers in a new list. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
