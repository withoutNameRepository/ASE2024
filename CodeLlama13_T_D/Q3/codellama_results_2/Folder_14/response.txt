```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[5:8] if x > 0]
```
This function uses list slicing to extract the elements from index 5 to index 7 (both inclusive) and then filters out all negative integers using a list comprehension. The resulting list is returned. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
