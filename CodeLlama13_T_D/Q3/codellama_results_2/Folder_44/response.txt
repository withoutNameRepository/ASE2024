```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return list(range(13, 69)) if any(i > 0 for i in lst) else []
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from index 13 to index 68, both inclusive. The `any` function is used to check if there are any positive integers in the input list. If there are none, an empty list is returned.
