```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 43 <= x <= 86 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, returning only those that are positive integers between 43 and 86, both inclusive. If no such integer exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
