def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [i for i in range(1, 9) if i in lst]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of positive integers from index 0 to index 8, both inclusive. It checks if each integer in the specified range is present in the input list `lst`, and returns an empty list if no positive integers exist in the range.
