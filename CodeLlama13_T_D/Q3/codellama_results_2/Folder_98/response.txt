```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return list(range(1, 7)) if any(i > 0 for i in my_list) else []
```
This function uses a generator expression `list(range(1, 7))` to create the desired range of positive integers. The `any` function is used to check if there are any positive integers in the list, and if so, the list is returned. If not, an empty list is returned instead.
