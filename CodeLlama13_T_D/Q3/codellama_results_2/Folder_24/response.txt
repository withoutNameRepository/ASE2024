```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [n for n in nums if 74 <= n <= 95 and n > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `nums` and returns the list of positive integers from index 74 to index 95, both inclusive. If no such integer exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
