```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 75 <= x <= 85 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and checks whether each element is within the specified range (index 75 to index 85, both inclusive). If an element is positive, it is added to the resulting list. The resulting list is then returned.
