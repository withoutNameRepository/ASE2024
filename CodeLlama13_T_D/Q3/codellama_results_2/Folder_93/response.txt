```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[75:94+1] if x > 0] or []
```
This is a solution that uses list comprehension to select only the positive integers from index 75 to index 94, both inclusive. The `or []` at the end of the line ensures that an empty list is returned if no positive integers exist in the specified range.
