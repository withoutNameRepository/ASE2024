```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 52 <= x <= 71 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and returns a new list containing only the positive integers between 52 and 71, both inclusive. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
