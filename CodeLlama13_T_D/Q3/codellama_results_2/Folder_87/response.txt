def all_pos_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return [n for n in numbers if 36 <= n <= 46 and n > 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that filters the input list `numbers` to include only positive integers between index 36 and index 46, both inclusive. The `if` clause checks whether the current number is greater than or equal to 36 and less than or equal to 46, and also ensures that it's a positive integer using the `and` operator. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
