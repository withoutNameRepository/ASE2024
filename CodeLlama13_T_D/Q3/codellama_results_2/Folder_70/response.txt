```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return list(filter(lambda x: 28 <= x <= 32, my_list))
```
This function uses the `filter()` function to filter out all elements in `my_list` that are not between 28 and 32 (both inclusive). The resulting filtered list is then converted back to a list using `list()`. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
