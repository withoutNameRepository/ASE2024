```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if 82 <= i <= 86 and i > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, and returns only those that are positive integers between indices 82 and 86, both inclusive. The `and` operator is used to ensure that the index of each element is greater than 0. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
