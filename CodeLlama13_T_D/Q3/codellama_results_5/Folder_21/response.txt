def all_pos_ints_inclusive(mylist):
```
return [x for x in mylist if 639 <= x <= 975 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `mylist` and returns only those that are positive integers between 639 and 975, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
