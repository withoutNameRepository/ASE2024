```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[60:201] if x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (from index 60 to index 200, both inclusive) and returns only the positive integers. If no positive integers exist in this range, an empty list is returned.
