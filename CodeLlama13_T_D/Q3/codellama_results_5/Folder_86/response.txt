```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums if 31 <= x <= 34 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums`, keeping only those elements that are between 31 and 34, both inclusive. The `and` keyword is used to ensure that the element is also positive (greater than 0). If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
