```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 25 <= x <= 59 and x > 0]
```
Explanation:

* The function takes a list of integers as input.
* It uses list comprehension to create a new list containing all positive integers from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive.
* The `if` clause checks if each element in the list is between 25 and 59, both inclusive, and if it's greater than zero. If either condition is not met, the element is not included in the new list.
* The function returns an empty list if no positive integers exist in the specified range.
