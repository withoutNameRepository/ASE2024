```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(list):
    return [i for i in range(1, 9) if i in list and i > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and returns a new list of positive integers from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
