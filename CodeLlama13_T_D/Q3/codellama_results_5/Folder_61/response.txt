```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in range(8) if i in my_list and i > 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the indices from 0 to 7, inclusive. It checks whether each index is a positive integer (i.e., greater than 0) and whether it exists in the input list. If both conditions are met, the index is included in the output list.
