```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 29 <= x <= 79 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `lst` and checks whether each element is between 29 and 79, both inclusive, and greater than 0. If any such element exists, it is included in the resulting list. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
