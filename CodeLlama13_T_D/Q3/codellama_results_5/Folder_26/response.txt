```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 62 <= x <= 99 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `my_list`, and returns a new list containing only the positive integers that are between indices 62 and 99, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
