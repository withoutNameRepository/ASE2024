```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [i for i in range(1, max(nums) + 1)]
```
This function uses list comprehension to generate a list of positive integers from index 0 to the maximum value in the input list plus one. The `max` function is used to find the maximum value in the input list, and the `range` function generates a list of integers from 1 to that maximum value plus one. The resulting list is then returned. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
