```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [i for i in range(0, 11) if i in lst and i > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of integers (from 0 to 10 inclusive), and checks whether each integer is present in the input list `lst` and greater than 0. If both conditions are met, the integer is included in the output list. The resulting list is returned.
