```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in range(0, max(my_list) + 1) if i > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list that contains all positive integers from index 0 to index 1 (both inclusive). If no positive integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.

Here's an example usage of this function:
```python
my_list = [1, -2, 3, 4, 5]
result = all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list)
print(result)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
