```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 533 <= x <= 605 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, selecting only those elements that are positive integers between 533 and 605 (both inclusive). If no such element exists in the range, an empty list is returned.
