```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 29 <= x <= 93 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `lst`, and returns only those elements that are positive integers between indices 29 and 93, both inclusive. The condition `x > 0` is added to ensure that only positive integers are included in the result.
