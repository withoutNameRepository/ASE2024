```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 31 <= x <= 72 and x > 0]
```
Note: This solution uses list comprehension to create a new list with only the positive integers between 31 and 72, both inclusive. The `and` keyword is used to ensure that the integer is also greater than zero.
