```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return [n for n in numbers if 34 <= n <= 55 and n > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list of integers, and returns only those integers that are positive and within the specified range. The `34 <= n <= 55` condition ensures that only numbers between indices 34 and 55 (inclusive) are considered.
