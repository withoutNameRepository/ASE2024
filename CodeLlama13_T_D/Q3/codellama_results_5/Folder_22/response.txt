```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [n for n in nums if 40 <= n <= 200 and n > 0]
```
Here is the breakdown of the code:

* `nums`: The input list of integers.
* `[n for n in nums ... ]`: A list comprehension that iterates over each element `n` in `nums`.
	+ `if 40 <= n <= 200 and n > 0`: The condition that the current element must be a positive integer between 40 and 200, both inclusive.
* `[ ]`: An empty list is returned if no positive integers exist in the specified range.
