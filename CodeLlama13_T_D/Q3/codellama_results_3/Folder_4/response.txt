def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in range(12, 93) if i in my_list and i > 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing all the positive integers from index 12 to index 92, both inclusive. It does this by iterating over the specified range of indices using `range()` and checking if each integer is in the original list `my_list`, and if it's greater than 0 (since we only want positive integers). If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
