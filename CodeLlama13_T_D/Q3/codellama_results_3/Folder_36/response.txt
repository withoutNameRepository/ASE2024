```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if 246 <= i <= 750 and i > 0]
```
This is a Python function that takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the list of all positive integers from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

Here's an example usage:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, -3, 4, 5]
print(all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list)) # prints [4, 5]
```
