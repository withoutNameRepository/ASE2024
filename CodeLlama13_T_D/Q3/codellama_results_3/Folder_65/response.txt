def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [i for i in lst[56:98+1] if i > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers, `lst`, and returns a new list containing all positive integers between indices 56 and 98 (both inclusive). If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the positive integers from the input list. The `lst[56:98+1]` expression slices the input list and includes the indices 56 through 98 (both inclusive). The `if i > 0` clause filters out any negative or zero values in the resulting list.
