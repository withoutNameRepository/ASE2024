```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in range(0, 6) if i in my_list and i > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range of positive integers from 0 to 5 (both inclusive), and checks whether each integer is in the input `my_list` and greater than 0. If both conditions are true, the integer is included in the output list. The function returns an empty list if no positive integers exist in the specified range.

Here is a sample usage of the function:
```python
>>> all_pos_ints_inclusive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5])
[1, 2, 3, 5]
>>> all_pos_ints_inclusive([-1, -2, -3, 4, 5])
[]
```
