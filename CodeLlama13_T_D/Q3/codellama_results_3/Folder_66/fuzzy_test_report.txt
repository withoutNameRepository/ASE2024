Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[514, 12, -31, 283, 202, 53, -282, 404, 454, 121, -549, 401, 448, 5, -275, -217, -198, -209, 91, -264, 333, 341, -193, -88, -73, -105, -8, -58, -26, 335, 8, 531, -266, 74, 281, -240, 407, 450, -112, 252, -440, -288, 312, 513, 476, 357, -462, 184, 130, -535, 438, -431, -26, -340, 442, 241]

The correct answer was:
[438, 442]

But the LLM code returned:
[438, -431, -26, -340, 442]
