def all_pos_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[15:40] if x > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all positive integers from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The `lst[15:40]` part of the code slices the original list to get the desired range, and the `[x for x in lst[15:40] if x > 0]` part filters out any negative or zero values in the range.
