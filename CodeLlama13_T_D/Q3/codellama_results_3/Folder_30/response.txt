def all_pos_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return [number for number in numbers if 55 <= number <= 98 and number > 0]
```
Note: This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from the specified range. The `if` clause filters out any non-positive integers, and the `<= 98` ensures that the maximum value is inclusive.
