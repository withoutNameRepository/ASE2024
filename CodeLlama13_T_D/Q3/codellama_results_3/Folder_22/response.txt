```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 40 <= x <= 200 and x > 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of positive integers from index 40 to index 200, both inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The function uses a list comprehension with the condition `40 <= x <= 200` and `x > 0` to filter out non-positive integers and return only the positive integers in the specified range.
