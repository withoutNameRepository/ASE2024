```python
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 28 <= x <= 40 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, and filters out any elements that are not positive integers or fall outside the specified range. The resulting list is then returned.
