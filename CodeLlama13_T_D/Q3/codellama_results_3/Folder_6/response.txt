```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 10 <= x <= 66 and x > 0]
```
Note: This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from the input list, using the condition `10 <= x <= 66` to filter out any negative or non-positive integers.
