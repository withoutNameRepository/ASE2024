```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 56 <= x <= 82 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of positive integers from the input list. It checks each element `x` in the list to see if it is between 56 and 82, both inclusive, and greater than zero. If so, it includes it in the output list.
