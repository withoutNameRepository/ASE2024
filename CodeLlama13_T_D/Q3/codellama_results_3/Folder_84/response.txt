```
def all_pos_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 43 <= x <= 86 and x > 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list, and returns a new list of positive integers between indices 43 and 86 inclusive. If no positive integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
