```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[22:64] if x % -61 == 0] or []
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the integers from index 22 to index 63 (both inclusive) that are divisible by -61. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned instead.

For example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(all_ints_div_by_num(my_list)) # Output: [3, 6]
```
In this example, the function returns a list containing the values 3 and 6 from the input list, because they are the only two integers divisible by -61 in the specified range.
