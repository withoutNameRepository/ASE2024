```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if i % 8 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and keep only those that are divisible by 8. The `%` operator is used to check if an integer is divisible by 8. If no integers in the specified range are divisible by 8, an empty list is returned.
