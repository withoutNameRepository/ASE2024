```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[66:74+1] if x % -14 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers `my_list` as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers in the range from index 66 to index 74 (both inclusive) that are divisible by -14. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Here's an example usage of this function:
```
my_list = [123, 589, 67, 100, 45, 12, 7]
result = all_ints_div_by_num(my_list)
print(result) # Output: [67, 100]
```
