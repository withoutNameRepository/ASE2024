```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(arr):
    result = []
    for i in range(6):
        if arr[i] % 6 == 0:
            result.append(arr[i])
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers divisible by 6 from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list. The code uses a for loop to iterate through the list and checks if each element is divisible by 6 using the modulo operator (%). If it is, the integer is added to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.
