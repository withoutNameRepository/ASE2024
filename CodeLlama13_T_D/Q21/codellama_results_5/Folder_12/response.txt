```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[23:65+1] if x % -46 == 0]
```
This code defines a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by -46 from index 23 to index 65, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` between indices 23 and 65 (inclusive), and checks if each element is divisible by -46 using the modulo operator (`%`). If it is, the element is included in the output list. The output list is then returned.

For example:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(all_ints_div_by_num(my_list))
```
This would output `[3, 7, 11]`.
