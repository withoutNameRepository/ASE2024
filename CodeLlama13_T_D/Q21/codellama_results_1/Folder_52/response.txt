```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[42:98] if x % 46 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing only the elements that are divisible by 46 from index 42 to index 97, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
