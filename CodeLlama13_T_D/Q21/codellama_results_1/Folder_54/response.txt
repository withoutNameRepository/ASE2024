```
def all_ints_div_by_num(lst):
    return [i for i in lst[31:73] if i % -63 == 0] or []
```
This is a concise solution that uses list comprehension and the modulo operator to find the integers divisible by `-63` in the specified range. The `or []` at the end of the return statement ensures that an empty list is returned if no such integers exist.
