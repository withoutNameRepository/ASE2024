```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[4:4+1] if x % 3 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the integers from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive, that are divisible by 3. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
