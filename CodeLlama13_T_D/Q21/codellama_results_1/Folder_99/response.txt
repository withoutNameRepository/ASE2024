```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(numbers):
    return [x for x in numbers[161:971] if x % 763 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the integers that are divisible by 763 from index 161 to index 970, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
