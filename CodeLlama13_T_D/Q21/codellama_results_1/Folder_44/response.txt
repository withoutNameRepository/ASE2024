def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[66:81+1] if x % 77 == 0]
```
This is a Python function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing all the integers from index 66 to index 81 (both inclusive) that are divisible by 77. If no such integer exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The function uses a list comprehension to generate the output list based on the condition `x % 77 == 0`.
