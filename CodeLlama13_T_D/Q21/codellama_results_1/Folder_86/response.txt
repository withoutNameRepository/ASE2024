def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[43:74] if x % 88 == 0] or []
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and returns a new list containing only the integers that are divisible by 88. If no such integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
