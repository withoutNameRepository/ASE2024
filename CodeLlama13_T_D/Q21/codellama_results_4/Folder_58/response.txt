```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[255:618+1] if x % 965 == 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that loops through the specified range of indices and checks if each integer is divisible by 965. If it is, it is added to the output list. The `+1` in `my_list[255:618+1]` is necessary because Python's slicing syntax includes the stop index but excludes the start index, so we need to add one to get the correct range.
