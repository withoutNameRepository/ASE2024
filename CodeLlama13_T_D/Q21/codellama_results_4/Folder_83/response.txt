```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[40:401] if x % 7 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (40-400) and checks whether each integer is divisible by 7. If an integer is found that satisfies this condition, it is added to the output list. The output list is returned at the end of the function.
