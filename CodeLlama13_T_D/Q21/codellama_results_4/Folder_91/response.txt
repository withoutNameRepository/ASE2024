```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 5 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `my_list`, and returns only those elements that are divisible by 5. The `%` operator is used to check whether each element is divisible by 5, and the resulting list is returned. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
