```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[70:76+1] if x % -92 == 0]
```
This code defines a function `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing all the integers from index 70 to index 76 (both inclusive) that are divisible by -92. If no such integer exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

The function uses a list comprehension with the condition `x % -92 == 0` to filter out only the integers that are divisible by -92. The resulting list is then returned.
