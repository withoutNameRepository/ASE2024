```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(myList):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(myList)):
        if myList[i] % 9 == 0:
            result.append(myList[i])
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing all the elements from the original list that are divisible by 9, starting from index 0 to index 0 (both inclusive). If no such elements exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
