```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 6 == 0][:6]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers divisible by 6 from the input `my_list`, and then slices the resulting list to include only the first six elements. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
