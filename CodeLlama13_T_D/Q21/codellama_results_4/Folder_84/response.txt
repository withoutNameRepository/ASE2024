```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[52:53+1] if x % 93 == 0] or []
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and checks whether each integer is divisible by 93. If an integer is divisible by 93, it is included in the resulting list; otherwise, it is excluded. If no integers are divisible by 93 in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
