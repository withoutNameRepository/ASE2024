```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[50:54+1] if x % 84 == 0]
```
Here is the code you asked for: a function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers divisible by 84 from index 50 to index 54, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers from the given range that are divisible by 84. The `x % 84 == 0` condition checks whether each integer is divisible by 84. If it is, it is included in the output list; otherwise, it is not.
