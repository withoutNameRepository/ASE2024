```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[17:64] if x % 89 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing all the integers from index 17 to index 63 that are divisible by 89, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
