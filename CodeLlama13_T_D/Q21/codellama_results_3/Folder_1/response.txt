```
def all_ints_div_by_num(nums):
    return [n for i, n in enumerate(nums) if i >= 59 and i <= 77 and n % -95 == 0]
```
Note: This code uses list comprehension to filter the input list `nums` and create a new list of all integers divisible by `-95` from index 59 to index 77, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
