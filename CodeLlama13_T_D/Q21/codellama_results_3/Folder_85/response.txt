def all_ints_div_by_num(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[6:9] if x % -9 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers `nums` as input, and returns the list of all integers divisible by `-9` from indices 6 to 8, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The function uses a list comprehension to select the required elements from the input list.
