def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[62:71] if x % 58 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all integers divisible by 58 from index 62 to index 70, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The `for` loop iterates over the given range and checks if each integer is divisible by 58 using the modulo operator `%`. If it is divisible, it is included in the resulting list.
