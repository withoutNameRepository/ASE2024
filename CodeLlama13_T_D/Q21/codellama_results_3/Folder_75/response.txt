def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[12:34] if x % -91 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and checks whether each integer is divisible by -91. If it is, it is included in the output list. If not, it is excluded. The `if` clause is equivalent to `if x % -91 == 0`.
