```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[52:73] if x % 15 == 0]
```
Note that the function `all_ints_div_by_num` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a list of all integers from index 52 to index 72, both inclusive, that are divisible by -15. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and return only those that are divisible by 15. The function uses slicing to select the relevant subset of the list.
