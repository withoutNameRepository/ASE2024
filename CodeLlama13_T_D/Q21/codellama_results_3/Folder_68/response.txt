def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 8 == 0]
```
This is a Python function called `all_ints_div_by_num` that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the elements from the original list that are divisible by 8, starting from index 0 up to but not including index 0. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

For example, if we pass a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` as input to this function, it will return a list `[8]`.

Note that this function uses a list comprehension to create the new list of divisible numbers. The `x % 8 == 0` condition checks whether each number in the input list is divisible by 8, and if so, adds it to the output list.
