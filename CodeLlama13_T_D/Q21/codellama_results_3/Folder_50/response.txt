```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[36:47] if x % 28 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of integers divisible by 28 from index 36 to index 46, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.

Here's an example usage:
```
>>> all_ints_div_by_num([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
[36, 40, 44]
```
