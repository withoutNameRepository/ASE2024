```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 5 == 0][:6]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are divisible by 5. The `[:6]` at the end slices the resulting list, keeping only the first six elements. If there are no divisible integers in the range, an empty list is returned.
