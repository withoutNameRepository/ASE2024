```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[32:36] if x % 91 == 0]
```
Explanation:

* `my_list[32:36]` selects the list of integers from index 33 to index 35, both inclusive.
* `x for x in my_list[32:36] if x % 91 == 0` is a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) that selects only the integers divisible by 91 from the original list.
* The resulting list of divisible integers is returned. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
