```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[87:89+1] if x % 55 == 0] or []
```
This is a concise and efficient solution that uses list comprehension to filter the required integers from the input list. The `or []` at the end of the return statement ensures that an empty list is returned if no such integers exist in the specified range.
