```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the integers that are divisible by -19. The slice notation `[12:78]` is used to select the range of indices from index 12 to index 77, both inclusive. The `if` statement in the list comprehension checks whether each element `x` is divisible by -19, and if so, it adds it to the new list that is being constructed. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
