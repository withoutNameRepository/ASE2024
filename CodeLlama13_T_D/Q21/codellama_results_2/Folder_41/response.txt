```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(0, 6):
        if my_list[i] % 5 == 0:
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
Note that the `range` function is used to generate a sequence of integers from 0 to 5 (both inclusive), and then we check if each integer in this sequence is divisible by 5 using the modulo operator (`%`). If an integer is divisible by 5, it is appended to the result list. Finally, the resulting list is returned.
