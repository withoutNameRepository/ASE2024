def all_ints_div_by_num(lst):
    return [i for i in lst[315:352+1] if i % -858 == 0]
```
Note that this function uses list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are divisible by `-858` from the specified range. The `if i % -858 == 0` condition checks whether each integer in the range is divisible by `-858`, and only includes those that satisfy this condition in the output list.
