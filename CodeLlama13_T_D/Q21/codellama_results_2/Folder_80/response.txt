```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[27:86+1] if x % 29 == 0] or []
```
This is a list comprehension that returns the elements of `my_list` between indices 27 and 86, inclusive, if they are divisible by 29. If no such integers exist in this range, an empty list is returned.
