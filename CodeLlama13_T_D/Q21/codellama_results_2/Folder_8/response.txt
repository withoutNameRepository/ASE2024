```
def all_ints_div_by_num(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[34:56] if x % -83 == 0] or []
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers divisible by -83 from index 34 to index 55, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```
lst = [12, 34, 56, 78, 90, 101]
result = all_ints_div_by_num(lst)
print(result) # Output: []
```
