```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[75:86] if x % -40 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of all integers that are divisible by -40 from index 75 to index 85, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
