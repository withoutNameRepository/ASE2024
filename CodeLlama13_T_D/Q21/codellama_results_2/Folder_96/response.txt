```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[20:21] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are divisible by 2, and returns it. The list is created from the slice of `my_list` starting at index 20 (inclusive) and ending at index 21 (exclusive). The `if x % 2 == 0` clause ensures that only integers divisible by 2 are included in the new list. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
