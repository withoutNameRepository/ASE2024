```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[4:4+1] if x % 3 == 0]
```
This is a Python function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers divisible by 3 from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function will return an empty list. The `my_list[4:4+1]` syntax is used to get a slice of the list starting at index 4 and ending at index 4 (inclusive). The `[x for x in my_list if x % 3 == 0]` syntax is used to filter the list and only include elements that are divisible by 3.
