```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[12:69] if x % 71 == 0]
```
The function `all_ints_div_by_num` takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of all integers divisible by 71 from index 13 to index 68, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out only the elements that are divisible by 71.
