def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[18:39] if x % -97 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` from index 18 to index 38, both inclusive. The condition `if x % -97 == 0` is used to check if each element is divisible by -97. If it is divisible, it is included in the resulting list. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
