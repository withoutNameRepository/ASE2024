```python
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[73:82+1] if x % -57 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers that are divisible by -57 from index 73 to index 82, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
