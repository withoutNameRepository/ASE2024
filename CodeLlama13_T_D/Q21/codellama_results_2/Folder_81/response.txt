```
def all_ints_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 5 == 0 and x <= len(my_list)]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and returns a new list containing only the elements that are divisible by 5. The `and x <= len(my_list)` clause ensures that only elements up to index 2, both inclusive, are considered for inclusion in the returned list. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
