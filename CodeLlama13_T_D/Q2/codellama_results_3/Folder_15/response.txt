```python
def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:4]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the first 3 elements of the list, both exclusive. The `[:4]` syntax is used to specify that we want the first 3 elements of the list, without including the element at index 3 (which would be included if we used `[:3]`).
