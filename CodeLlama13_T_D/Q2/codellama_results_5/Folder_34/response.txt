def all_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[59:199]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the list of elements from index 60 to index 200, both exclusive. The `return` statement uses slice notation to specify that we want all elements from index 59 (inclusive) up to but not including index 199 (exclusive). This means that the function will return a list of length 141, starting at element 60 and ending at element 200.
