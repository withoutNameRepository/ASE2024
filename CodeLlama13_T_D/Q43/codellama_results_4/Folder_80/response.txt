```
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    primes = []
    for i in range(13, 29 + 1):
        if is_prime(my_list[i]):
            primes.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function is not included in the solution, as it is a separate function that needs to be implemented separately.
