```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(10, 13):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            prime_numbers.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
This code defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 10 to index 12, both inclusive. The function uses a loop to iterate over the specified range and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. If a prime number is found, it is added to the `prime_numbers` list, which is then sorted and returned. If no prime numbers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
