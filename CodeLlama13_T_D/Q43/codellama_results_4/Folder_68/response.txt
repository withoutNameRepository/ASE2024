        is_prime = True
        for j in range(2, int(my_list[i]**0.5) + 1):
            if my_list[i] % j == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break

This solution uses a list comprehension to find the prime numbers between indices 1 and 5, both inclusive. The `is_prime` variable is used to keep track of whether a number is prime or not, and the `continue` statement is used to skip to the next iteration if a number has already been found to be prime.
