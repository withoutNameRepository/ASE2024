```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(23, 40):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function is not defined in this solution. It is up to the user to define it or use a pre-defined function from a library, such as NumPy's `np.isprime`.
