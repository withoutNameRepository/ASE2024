This function uses the `is_prime` function to check if a given number is prime or not. If a number is prime, it appends it to the list of prime numbers. Finally, it returns the sorted list of prime numbers in descending order. The `range` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list between 19 and 90, both inclusive. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
