def find_primes_between_indices(nums):

    for i in range(89, 94):

```
This code defines a function `find_primes_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 89 to index 93, both inclusive. The returned list is in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The function first creates an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers found in the input list. It then loops through indices 89 to 93 of the input list and checks if each element is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If it is a prime number, it appends the element to the `primes` list.

Finally, the function returns the sorted `primes` list in descending order.
