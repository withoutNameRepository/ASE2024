```python
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(16, 25 + 1):
        if is_prime(my_list[i]):
            prime_numbers.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(prime_numbers, reverse=True)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number in the list is a prime number or not. If it is a prime number, it is added to a new list called `prime_numbers`. The `sorted` function is then used to sort the `prime_numbers` list in descending order and return it.
Note that the `range` function is used to iterate over the indices of the list from 16 to 25, both inclusive.
Also note that if no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
