This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 28 to index 83, both inclusive. The function uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number in the range is a prime number or not. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The function starts by defining an empty list called `prime_nums`. It then loops through the indices from 28 to 83 and checks if each index is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If a prime number is found, it is added to the `prime_nums` list. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of all prime numbers found in the specified range.
