```
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(187, 271):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function has not been included in this solution as it is a separate function that checks whether a number is prime or not.
