```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(20, 49):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a sorted list of all prime numbers from index 20 to index 48, both inclusive. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function will return an empty list. The `is_prime` function is not included in this code since it is assumed to be defined separately.
