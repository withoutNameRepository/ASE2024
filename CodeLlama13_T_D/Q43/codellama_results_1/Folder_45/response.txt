```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(23, 40):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```

This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of all prime numbers between indices 23 and 39, both inclusive. If no prime number exists in the specified range, it returns an empty list. The `is_prime()` function is used to check if each number in the list is prime or not.

Note that the `sorted()` function is used to sort the returned list of primes in ascending order.
