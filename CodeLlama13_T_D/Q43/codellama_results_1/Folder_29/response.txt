```python
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(24, 32+1):
        if my_list[i] not in prime_numbers:
            prime_numbers.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(prime_numbers, reverse=True)
```
This code defines a function `find_primes_between_indices` that takes one argument, `my_list`, which should be a list of integers. The function returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 24 to index 32, both inclusive, in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The code uses a for loop to iterate over each element in `my_list` between indices 24 and 32, inclusive. For each element that is not already present in the `prime_numbers` list, it adds the element to the list. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of prime numbers, with duplicates removed, in descending order using the `sorted()` built-in function.
