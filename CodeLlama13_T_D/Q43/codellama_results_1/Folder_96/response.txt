```
def find_primes_between_indices(nums):
    primes = []
    for i in range(31, 68):
        if is_prime(nums[i]):
            primes.append(nums[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function is not included in the code snippet for simplicity. You can implement it as needed or use a pre-existing implementation from a library like `math`.
