```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(61, 80 + 1):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function is not provided in the question, so it has to be implemented separately or used from an external library.
