```python
def find_primes_between_indices(nums):
    primes = []
    for i in range(19, 72):
        if is_prime(nums[i]):
            primes.append(nums[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function has not been included in the code snippet for brevity. You may need to define this function separately.
