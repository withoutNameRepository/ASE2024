```python
def find_primes_between_indices(nums):
    primes = []
    for i in range(20, 25+1):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function has not been defined here, but it should be implemented as a separate function to check whether an integer is prime or not.
