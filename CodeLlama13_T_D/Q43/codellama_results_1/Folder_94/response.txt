```python
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    primes = []
    for i in range(10, 13):
        if is_prime(my_list[i]):
            primes.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers between indices 10 and 12, both inclusive. If no prime number exists in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
The `is_prime` function is not defined in this solution. It should be defined separately according to your requirements.
