def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(497, 930+1):

This function iterates over the given list of integers and checks whether each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. If a prime number is found, it is added to the `primes` list. Finally, the `sorted` function is used to return the primes in descending order.

Note that the `range` function is used to iterate over the indices of the given list, and the `+1` is used to include index 930 in the iteration.
