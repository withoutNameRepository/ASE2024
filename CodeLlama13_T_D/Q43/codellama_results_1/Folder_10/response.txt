```python
def find_primes_between_indices(nums):
    primes = []
    for i in range(61, 80):
        if is_prime(nums[i]):
            primes.append(nums[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```

This function first iterates over the list of integers `nums` and checks whether each number is prime using the `is_prime()` function. If a prime number is found, it is appended to the `primes` list. Finally, the `sorted()` function is used to return the sorted list of prime numbers in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Note that the `is_prime()` function is not provided in the question and should be implemented separately.
