```
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(131, 815+1):
        if is_prime(i):
            prime_numbers.append(i)
    return sorted(prime_numbers, reverse=True)
```

This function uses the `is_prime()` function to check whether a number is prime or not, and appends all prime numbers between indices 131 and 815 (both inclusive) to a list. The list is then sorted in descending order and returned. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
