```python
def find_primes_between_indices(nums):
    primes = []
    for i in range(55, 87+1):
        if is_prime(nums[i]):
            primes.append(nums[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number between indices 55 and 87 (both inclusive) is prime, and appends it to a list of primes if it is. The resulting list is then sorted in ascending order before being returned. If no prime numbers are found in this range, an empty list is returned instead.
