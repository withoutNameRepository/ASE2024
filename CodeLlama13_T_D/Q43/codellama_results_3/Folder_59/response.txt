```python
def find_primes_between_indices(list_of_integers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(5, 9):
        if is_prime(list_of_integers[i]):
            primes.append(list_of_integers[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a sorted list of all prime numbers from index 5 to index 8, both inclusive. The returned list is in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The `is_prime` function is not defined here, but it should be a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns True if it is a prime number, False otherwise.
