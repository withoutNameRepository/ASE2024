```python
def find_primes_between_indices(nums):
    primes = []
    for i in range(89, 94):
        if is_prime(nums[i]):
            primes.append(nums[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```

This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 89 to index 93, both inclusive. The returned list is in descending order if there are any prime numbers in the specified range. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The `is_prime` function checks whether a given integer is prime or not by iterating through all integers up to its square root and checking whether it is divisible by any of them.
