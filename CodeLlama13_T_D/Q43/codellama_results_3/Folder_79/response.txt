```
def find_primes_between_indices(nums):
    primes = []
    for i in range(33, 36):
        if is_prime(nums[i]):
            primes.append(nums[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime or not. It iterates through the list of integers from index 33 to index 35, both inclusive, and appends the prime numbers to a new list called `primes`. Finally, it returns the sorted list of prime numbers. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Note: The `is_prime` function is not included in this solution, but you can find it in many online resources or implement your own version.
