```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(15, 49):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This code defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 15 to index 48 (both inclusive), in descending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the indices between 15 and 48 (inclusive) and checks if each number at that index is prime using the `is_prime` function. If a number is prime, it is added to the `primes` list. The function returns the sorted `primes` list in descending order.

The `is_prime` function is not provided in this solution and is assumed to be defined elsewhere.
