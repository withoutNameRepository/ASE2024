def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(287, 928 + 1):

```
This code defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a sorted list of all prime numbers from index 287 to index 928, both inclusive. The function uses the `is_prime` function defined below to check if each number is prime.
```
def is_prime(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
This code defines a function called `is_prime` that takes an integer `n` as an argument and returns `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the fact that all prime numbers are greater than 1 and have no factors other than 1 and themselves to quickly determine whether a number is prime or not.
