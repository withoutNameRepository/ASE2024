```
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(24, 84):
        if is_prime(i):
            prime_numbers.append(i)
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` function from the previous solution to check if each number between 24 and 83 is a prime number, and adds it to the list of prime numbers if it is. The list of prime numbers is then returned in ascending order. If no prime numbers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Note: This function assumes that `my_list` is a list of integers, and raises a `TypeError` if it is not. It also assumes that `is_prime` has been defined previously as a function that takes one argument, an integer, and returns whether or not it is prime.
