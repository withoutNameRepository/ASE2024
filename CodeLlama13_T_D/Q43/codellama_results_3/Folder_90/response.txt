This code defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers between indices 413 and 448, both inclusive. The function uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number in the range is prime, and appends it to the `primes` list if it is. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of primes.
