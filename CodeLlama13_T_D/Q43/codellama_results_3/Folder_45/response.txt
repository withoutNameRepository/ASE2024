def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(23, 40):

            prime_numbers.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 23 to index 39, both inclusive. The `is_prime` function is used to check if each number in the list is prime or not. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Note: This code assumes that the input list is a Python list and that the indices are valid for the list.
