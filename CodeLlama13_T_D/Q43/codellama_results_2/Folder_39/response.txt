```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(69, 81):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
This code defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 69 to index 80, both inclusive. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function returns an empty list. The function uses the `is_prime` function to determine if each number is prime or not.

The `sorted` function is used to sort the list of primes in ascending order before returning it.
