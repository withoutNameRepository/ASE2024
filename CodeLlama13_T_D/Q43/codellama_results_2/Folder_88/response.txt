```python
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(66, 81):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function is not included in the code snippet, but it should be defined as a separate function that takes an integer and returns True if the number is prime, False otherwise.
