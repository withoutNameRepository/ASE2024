```python
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    primes = []
    for i in range(1, 6):
        if is_prime(my_list[i]):
            primes.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```

This function defines a function called `find_primes_between_indices` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sorted list of all prime numbers from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. The returned list should be in ascending order. If no prime number exists in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

The function first defines a new list called `primes` that will store the prime numbers found between indices 1 and 5 (both inclusive). It then uses a for loop to iterate over each index from 1 to 5 (inclusive) and checks if the corresponding element in the input list is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If it is a prime number, it appends that number to the `primes` list.

Finally, the function returns the sorted list of prime numbers found between indices 1 and 5 (both inclusive), or an empty list if no prime numbers exist in the specified range.
