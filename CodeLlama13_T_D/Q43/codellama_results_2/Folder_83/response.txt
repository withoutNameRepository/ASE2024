def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(14, 73+1):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This function first initializes an empty list called `primes`. Then it loops through the indices between 14 and 73 (both inclusive), and for each index `i`, it checks if the corresponding number in the input list is prime using the `is_prime` function. If the number at that index is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list. Finally, it returns the sorted list of primes in descending order (using the `sorted()` function with the `reverse=True` argument).
Note that the input list should be a list of integers for this function to work correctly. Also, if no prime number exists between indices 14 and 73 (both inclusive), then the function returns an empty list.
