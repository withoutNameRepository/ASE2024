```python
def find_primes_between_indices(my_list):
    primes = []
    for i in range(20, 49):
        if my_list[i] not in primes and is_prime(my_list[i]):
            primes.append(my_list[i])
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` function to check whether a number is prime or not, and appends it to the `primes` list if it is a prime number and has not already been added. The `sorted` function is then used to sort the `primes` list in descending order, and the resulting list is returned. If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
