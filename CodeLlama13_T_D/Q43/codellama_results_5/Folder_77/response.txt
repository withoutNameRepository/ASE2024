```python
def find_primes_between_indices(list_of_ints):
    primes = []
    for i in range(287, 928+1):
        if is_prime(list_of_ints[i]):
            primes.append(list_of_ints[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function is not provided in the question, you can implement it according to your requirements or use an existing implementation from a library like `math`.
