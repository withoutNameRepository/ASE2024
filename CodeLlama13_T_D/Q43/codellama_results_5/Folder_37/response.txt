```
def find_primes_between_indices(numbers):
    primes = []
    for i in range(13, 69):
        if is_prime(numbers[i]):
            primes.append(numbers[i])
    return sorted(primes)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function is not included in the solution, you can implement it yourself or use an existing implementation from a third-party library.
