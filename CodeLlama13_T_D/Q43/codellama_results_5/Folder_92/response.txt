Explanation:

* The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a sorted list of all prime numbers between indices 7 and 8, both inclusive.
* The `for` loop iterates over the indices 7 and 8, and checks if each number is a prime using the `is_prime()` function. If a number is a prime, it is appended to the list of primes.
* The returned list is sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.
* If no prime number exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
