    for num in range(2, x+1):

This code defines a function called `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as its argument. The function returns a list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than the integer at index 92 in the input tuple, sorted in ascending order.

The function uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime and does not contain any 0 digits. If a number is prime and does not contain any 0 digits, it is added to a list called `prime_list`. The function then returns the sorted list of left-truncatable prime numbers.

The `is_prime` function is not defined in this code snippet. It should be implemented separately based on the specific requirements of your use case.
