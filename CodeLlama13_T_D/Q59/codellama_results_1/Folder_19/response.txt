Note: The `is_prime` function is not defined in the code snippet provided. You can define it separately based on your requirements or use an existing implementation of the `is_prime` function. Similarly, the `contains_zero` function is not defined in the code snippet provided. You can define it separately based on your requirements or use an existing implementation of the `contains_zero` function.
