```
def all_left_truncatable_prime(numbers):
    x = numbers[77]
    prime_list = []
    
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and not contains_zero(str(i)):
            prime_list.append(i)
            
    return sorted(prime_list)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function checks whether a number is prime or not, and the `contains_zero` function checks whether a string contains any zero or not. These functions are not included in the code snippet as they are not relevant to the question.
