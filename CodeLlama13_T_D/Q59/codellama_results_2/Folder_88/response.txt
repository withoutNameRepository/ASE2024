```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(numbers):
    primes = []
    for x in numbers:
        if is_prime(x) and no_zeros(str(x)):
            primes.append(x)
    return sorted(primes)
```
It's worth noting that this code only generates one solution, without any explanation or justification. The function `is_prime` and `no_zeros` are not defined in the code snippet, so it is assumed they are already defined elsewhere. Additionally, the code only generates one solution, without considering the possibility of multiple solutions or edge cases.
