def all_left_truncatable_prime(numbers):
    primes = []
    for x in numbers:

Note that this function uses another function `is_prime` to check whether a given number is prime or not, and `no_leading_zeros` to check whether the number contains any leading zeros. These functions are not included in the provided code as they are not relevant to the solution of the problem.
