def all_left_truncatable_prime(numbers):
    x = numbers[77]
    prime_list = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and not '0' in str(i):

    return sorted(prime_list)
```

This code defines a function `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. The function uses the `is_prime` function to check if each number is prime, and it also checks that there are no '0's in the number. If both conditions are met, the number is appended to a list called `prime_list`. Finally, the function returns the sorted list of left-truncatable prime numbers less than x.
