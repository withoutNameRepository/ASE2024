```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(tuple_of_positive_integers):
    x = tuple_of_positive_integers[29]
    left_truncatable_primes = []
    for i in range(10, x+1):
        if is_left_truncatable_prime(i):
            left_truncatable_primes.append(i)
    return sorted(left_truncatable_primes, reverse=True)
```

This function takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument and returns the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than x, where x is the integer at index 29 in the tuple. The function uses the `is_left_truncatable_prime` function to check if each number in the range from 10 to x+1 is a left-truncatable prime number. If it is, then the number is added to the list of left-truncatable primes. Finally, the list is sorted in descending order and returned as the output of the function.
