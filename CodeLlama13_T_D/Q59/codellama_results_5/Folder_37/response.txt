```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(nums):
    x = nums[35]
    primes = []
    for i in range(x+1, 0, -1):
        if is_prime(i) and '0' not in str(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This function defines a function called `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as its argument. The function returns the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than the integer at index 35 in the input tuple, sorted in descending order.

The function first extracts the integer at index 35 from the input tuple and stores it in a variable called `x`. It then initializes an empty list called `primes` to store all left-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`.

The function then uses a for loop to iterate over the integers from `x+1` down to 0, using a step size of -1. For each integer in this range, it checks whether it is a prime number and does not contain any zeros. If both conditions are satisfied, the integer is appended to the `primes` list.

Finally, the function returns the sorted `primes` list, with the largest elements first.
