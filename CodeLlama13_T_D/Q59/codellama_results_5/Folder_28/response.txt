```python
def all_left_truncatable_prime(x):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and not "0" in str(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes)
```
This code defines a function called `all_left_truncatable_prime` that takes an argument which is a tuple of positive integers, and returns the list of all left-truncatable prime numbers less than the integer at index 19. The function first generates a list of all prime numbers less than or equal to the given number using the `is_prime` function, and then checks if each prime number contains no "0" in its string representation. If so, it appends the prime number to the `primes` list. Finally, it returns the sorted list of left-truncatable prime numbers less than the given number.
