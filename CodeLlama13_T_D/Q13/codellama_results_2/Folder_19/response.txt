```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    # Find the second largest number in the list
    second_largest = None
    for i in range(3, 6):
        if numbers[i] > second_largest:
            second_largest = numbers[i]
    return second_largest
```
This code defines a function called `find_second_largest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return `None`. The function uses a loop to iterate over the elements in the specified range and finds the second largest number by comparing each element with the current second largest number found so far.

The code only uses built-in Python functions and data structures, and does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks. It is efficient and easy to understand, making it a good solution for this problem.
