```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    if len(numbers) <= 1:
        return None

    numbers.sort()
    second_largest = numbers[686:987][-2]

    if not second_largest:
        return None

    return second_largest
```
Note that the function `find_second_largest_num` takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 686 to index 987, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return 'None'. The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
