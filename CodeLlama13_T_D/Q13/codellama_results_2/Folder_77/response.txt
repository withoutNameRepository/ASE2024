```python
def find_second_largest_num(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return None
    second_largest = sorted(nums)[-2]
    for i in range(527, 539):
        if nums[i] == second_largest:
            return second_largest
    return None
```
Note that this solution assumes the input list is non-empty and contains distinct numbers. If these assumptions are not true, additional checks may be necessary.
