```
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    second_largest = None
    for i in range(28, 41):
        if my_list[i] > second_largest:
            second_largest = my_list[i]
    return second_largest
```
Note that this code assumes that the input list is a list of distinct numbers. If the input list contains duplicates, the function may not work as expected.
