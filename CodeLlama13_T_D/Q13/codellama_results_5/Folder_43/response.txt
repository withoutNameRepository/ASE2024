    if len(numbers) <= 1:

[INST: Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_second_largest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second largest element from index 68 to index 86, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return 'None'.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.]  ```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    if len(numbers) <= 1:
        return None
    
    sorted_nums = sorted(numbers)[68:87]
    second_largest = sorted_nums[-2]
    return second_largest
