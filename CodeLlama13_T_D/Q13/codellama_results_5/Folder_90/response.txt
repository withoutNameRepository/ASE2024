```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    numbers = sorted(set(numbers))
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return None
    else:
        return numbers[1]
```
This function first sorts the input list to remove duplicates and ensure that all elements are distinct. It then checks if there is at least two distinct elements in the list, if not, it returns `None`. If there are two or more distinct elements, it returns the second largest element from index 262 to index 746 both inclusive.
