```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 27 to index 55, both inclusive. If there is no such element, it returns 'None'. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list and find the second largest element. It starts by initializing `second_largest` to None, then iterates through the list from index 27 to index 55 and checks if each element is larger than `second_largest`. If an element is larger, it updates `second_largest` with that value. Finally, it returns `second_largest`.
