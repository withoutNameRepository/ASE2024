```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    # Find the second largest element from index 209 to index 556, both inclusive
    second_largest = None
    for i in range(209, 557):
        if numbers[i] > second_largest:
            second_largest = numbers[i]
    return second_largest
```
The code above creates a function called `find_second_largest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, and returns the second largest element from index 209 to index 556, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return `None`. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list of numbers, starting from index 209, and checks if each number is larger than the current second largest number. If a larger number is found, it replaces the current second largest number. Finally, the function returns the second largest number.
