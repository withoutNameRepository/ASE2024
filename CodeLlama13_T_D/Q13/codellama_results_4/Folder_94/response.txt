def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    second_largest = None
    for i in range(28, 41):
        if numbers[i] != numbers[27]:

```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 28 to index 40, both inclusive. If there is no such element, it returns `None`. The function first sorts the input list, then iterates over the elements between indices 28 and 40 (both inclusive) and checks if any of them are not equal to the largest element (at index 27). If a non-largest element is found, that element is assigned to `second_largest` and the function returns it. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.
