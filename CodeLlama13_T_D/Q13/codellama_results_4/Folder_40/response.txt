def find_second_largest_num(nums):
    nums.sort()
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return None
    else:
        return nums[2]
```
This code sorts the list of numbers in ascending order using the `sort()` method, and then checks the length of the sorted list to make sure it is greater than or equal to 3. If so, it returns the element at index 2, which is the second largest element from indices 0 to 2, both inclusive. If the length is less than 3, it returns `None`.
