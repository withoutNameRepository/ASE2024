```python
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    largest = 0
    second_largest = 0
    for i in range(37, 52):
        if my_list[i] > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = my_list[i]
        elif my_list[i] > second_largest:
            second_largest = my_list[i]
    return second_largest
```
This function takes in a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 37 to index 51, both inclusive. If there is no such element, it returns 'None'.
