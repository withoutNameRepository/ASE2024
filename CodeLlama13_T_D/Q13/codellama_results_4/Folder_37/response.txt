```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 5:
        return None
    numbers = sorted(numbers)
    second_largest = numbers[4]
    for i in range(1, 5):
        if numbers[i] == second_largest:
            return None
    return second_largest
```
This function first checks if the input list is shorter than 5 elements. If so, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it sorts the list and finds the fifth element (index 4) as the second largest number. It then iterates through the first four elements (indices 1 to 4) and checks if any of them match the second largest number found in step 3. If any match is found, the function returns `None`. Finally, it returns the second largest number if no matches are found.
