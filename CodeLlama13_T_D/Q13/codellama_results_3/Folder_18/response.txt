def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[35:50][-2] if len(my_list) >= 50 else None
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 35 to index 49, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return 'None'. The code first sorts the list using the built-in `sorted()` function, then slices the list between indices 35 and 49, and finally returns the last (i.e., second) element of the resulting slice. If the length of the list is less than 50, the function returns 'None'.
