```python
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    largest = None
    second_largest = None
    
    for i in range(100, 201):
        num = my_list[i]
        if largest is None or num > largest:
            largest = num
        elif second_largest is None or num > second_largest:
            second_largest = num
    
    return second_largest
```
Note: This code assumes that the input list contains at least 100 elements. If there are fewer than 100 elements, the function will not work correctly.
