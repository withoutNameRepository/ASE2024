def find_second_largest_num(distinct_nums):
    sorted_nums = sorted(distinct_nums)
    return sorted_nums[75:89][-1] if len(sorted_nums[75:89]) > 0 else None
```
Note: The `sorted()` function sorts the list of distinct numbers in ascending order, and then we take the slice from index 75 to index 88 (both inclusive) using `[75:89]`. This gives us a new list with only the elements that are between indices 75 and 88. We then return the last element of this new list, which is the second largest element in the original list. If there are no elements between indices 75 and 88, we return `None`.
