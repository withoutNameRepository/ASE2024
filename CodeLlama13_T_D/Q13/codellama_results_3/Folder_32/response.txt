```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    sorted_nums = sorted(numbers)
    for i in range(21, 98):
        if i < len(sorted_nums) - 1 and sorted_nums[i] == sorted_nums[i + 1]:
            continue
        return sorted_nums[i]
    return None
```
This function first sorts the input list of numbers in ascending order using the built-in `sorted()` function. It then iterates over the list from index 21 to index 97, both inclusive, and checks if each element is equal to the next element (i.e., it skips any duplicates). If there are no duplicates between indices 21 and 97, the function returns the second largest element from that range. If there are no elements in the given range, the function returns `None`.
Note that this solution assumes the input list of numbers is distinct (i.e., it does not contain any duplicates).
