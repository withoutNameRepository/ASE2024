```python
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    if len(my_list) < 2:
        return None
    second_largest = sorted(my_list)[-2]
    if my_list[36:47].count(second_largest) > 0:
        return second_largest
    else:
        return None
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 36 to index 46, both inclusive. If there is no such element, it returns `None`. The function first checks if the length of the input list is at least 2, otherwise it cannot have a second largest element. Then it sorts the list using `sorted()` and selects the second-to-last element. Finally, it checks if the second-largest element appears in the sublist from index 36 to index 46, both inclusive. If it does, it returns that element. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
