```python
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    # Find the second largest element in the list
    second_largest = None
    for i in range(33, 37):
        if my_list[i] > second_largest:
            second_largest = my_list[i]
    
    return second_largest
```
This code defines a function called `find_second_largest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers. The function iterates through the list and finds the largest element between indices 33 to 36 (both inclusive), and returns it. If there is no such element, the function returns None.

Note: This code assumes that the input list contains only distinct numbers. If the list contains duplicates, the function may not work as expected.
