```python
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    largest = None
    second_largest = None
    
    for num in my_list:
        if num > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = num
        elif num > second_largest:
            second_largest = num
            
    return second_largest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive. If there is no such element, it returns `None`.
