```python
def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 5:
        return None
    
    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)[::-1]
    second_largest = sorted_numbers[3]
    return second_largest
```
This function first checks if the input list has at least 5 elements, and if not, it returns `None`. If the input list has more than 4 elements, it sorts the list in descending order using the `sorted()` function and `[::-1]` to reverse the order of the list. The second largest element is then returned from index 3 (index 0 starts at the end of the reversed list).
