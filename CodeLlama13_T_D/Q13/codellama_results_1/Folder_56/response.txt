This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If there is no such element, it returns 'None'. The function first checks if the length of the list is less than 2, in which case there is no second largest element, and returns None. It then initializes the second_largest variable with the value at index 1 of the list. Finally, it iterates through the rest of the list, starting from index 2, and checks if each element is larger than the current value of second_largest. If it finds a larger element, it updates second_largest to that element. In the end, the function returns the final value of second_largest, which is either the second largest element in the list or None if there is no such element.
