```python
def find_second_largest_num(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 2:
        return None
    else:
        sorted_list = sorted(my_list)[-2:]
        second_largest_num = sorted_list[0]
        return second_largest_num
```
This code defines a function called `find_second_largest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 246 to index 750, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function should return `None`. The function uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the list in descending order and then slices the last two elements of the sorted list using `[-2:]`, which are the second largest number and the third largest number. It then returns the first element of the sliced list, which is the second largest number.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(find_second_largest_num(my_list)) # prints 'None' because there are only 5 elements in the list

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(find_second_largest_num(my_list)) # prints '5' because the second largest number is index 5 and it falls within the range of indices 246 to 750, both inclusive
```
