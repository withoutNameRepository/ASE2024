```python
def find_second_largest_num(nums):
    nums = sorted(nums)[15:52]
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return None
    return nums[1]
```
Explanation:

* We first sort the input list `nums` and then take a slice from index 15 to index 51, both inclusive. This gives us a sublist of distinct numbers that are within the specified range.
* We check if the length of the sublist is less than 2, in which case there is no second largest element within the range and we return `None`.
* If the sublist has at least two elements, we return the second largest element from the sorted list. This will be at index 1, since Python indices start at 0.
