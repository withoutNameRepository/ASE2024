def find_second_largest_num(numbers):
    # Find the largest element in the list
    largest = max(numbers)
    
    # Create a new list with all elements except the largest one
    without_largest = [x for x in numbers if x != largest]

This code defines a function `find_second_largest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second largest element from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive. If there is no such element, the function returns `None`. The code first finds the largest element in the list using the `max` function, then creates a new list without that element using a list comprehension. Finally, it returns the second largest element from the remaining elements using slicing and sorting.
