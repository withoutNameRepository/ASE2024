```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    x = nums[79]
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_right_truncatable_prime(i, x):
            prime_numbers.append(i)
    return sorted(prime_numbers, reverse=True)
```
Note: The `is_prime` and `is_right_truncatable_prime` functions are not included in the code snippet provided above, as they are specific to the task at hand and may differ from the implementation used in other solutions.
