```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple):
    x = tuple[88]
    prime_numbers = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_right_truncatable_prime(i, 0):
            prime_numbers.append(i)
    return sorted(prime_numbers)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function has not been included in this solution. It should be defined separately to check if a given number is prime or not. Similarly, the `is_right_truncatable_prime` function has not been included here. It should be defined separately to check if a given number is a right-truncatable prime or not.
