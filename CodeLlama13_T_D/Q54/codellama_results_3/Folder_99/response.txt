```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(tuple_of_positive_integers):
    x = tuple_of_positive_integers[758]
    right_truncatable_primes = []
    for i in range(x, 0, -1):
        if is_right_truncatable_prime(i):
            right_truncatable_primes.append(i)
    return sorted(right_truncatable_primes)
```
Note: This code assumes that the input tuple of positive integers is in ascending order, and it starts from 0 (which means that the first number in the tuple is not included in the list of right-truncatable prime numbers). If this is not the case, you need to adjust the code accordingly.
