```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    x = nums[992]
    primes = []
    for i in range(x):
        if is_prime(i) and is_truncatable_prime(str(i)):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` and `is_truncatable_prime` functions, which are not included in this code snippet.

Note that the `range(x)` loop only checks for prime numbers less than x, so it is not necessary to check for primality after removing digits from a number.
