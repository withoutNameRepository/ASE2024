This code defines a function `all_right_truncatable_prime` that takes an integer `x` as input and returns the list of all right-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`. The function first generates a list of all prime numbers up to `x`, then checks which of these numbers are right-truncatable primes. Finally, it returns the sorted list of right-truncatable prime numbers.

The function `is_prime` is not defined in this code snippet, but it should take an integer `n` as input and return `True` if `n` is a prime number, and `False` otherwise. Similarly, the function `is_right_truncatable_prime` is also not defined, but it should take an integer `p` as input and return `True` if `p` is a right-truncatable prime number, and `False` otherwise.

Note that this code snippet assumes that the functions `is_prime` and `is_right_truncatable_prime` are defined elsewhere in the code or in a module that is imported into the code.
