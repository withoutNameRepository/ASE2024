```
def all_right_truncatable_prime(numbers):
    x = numbers[41]
    right_truncatable_primes = []
    for i in range(x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_right_truncatable_prime(i, x):
            right_truncatable_primes.append(i)
    return sorted(right_truncatable_primes, reverse=True)
```
Note: `is_prime` and `is_right_truncatable_prime` are two helper functions that check whether a number is prime and whether it is a right-truncatable prime number respectively. These functions have not been defined in this code snippet and can be implemented separately as needed.
