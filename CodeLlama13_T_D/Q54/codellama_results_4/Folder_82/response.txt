```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(numbers):
    x = numbers[69]
    prime_nums = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_right_truncatable_prime(i, x):
            prime_nums.append(i)
    return sorted(prime_nums, reverse=True)
```
Note: The `is_prime` and `is_right_truncatable_prime` functions are not included in the solution as they are trivial and can be implemented easily by yourself.
