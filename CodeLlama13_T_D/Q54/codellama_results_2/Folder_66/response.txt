This code defines a function called `all_right_truncatable_prime` that takes a tuple of positive integers as an argument. The function first extracts the integer at index 25 from the tuple and stores it in a variable named `x`. Then, it creates a list called `prime_numbers` by iterating over the range of numbers from 10 to `x + 1` (inclusive) and testing each number for primality using the `is_prime` function.

Next, the code creates another list called `right_truncatable_primes` by iterating over the elements of `prime_numbers` and testing each prime number for right-truncatability using the `is_right_truncatable_prime` function. If a prime number is found to be right-truncatable, it is added to the list.

Finally, the code returns the sorted list of right-truncatable primes less than `x`, sorted in descending order using the built-in `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` parameter. If there are no right-truncatable prime numbers less than `x`, an empty list is returned.

Note that this code assumes that you have already defined a function called `is_prime` and another function called `is_right_truncatable_prime`. These functions should be defined separately and should take an integer as their sole argument, returning True if the number is prime or right-truncatable, respectively.
