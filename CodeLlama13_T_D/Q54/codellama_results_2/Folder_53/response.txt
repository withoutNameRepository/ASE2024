```python
def all_right_truncatable_prime(numbers):
    x = numbers[86]
    prime_list = []
    for i in range(x, 10**7 + 1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_right_truncatable_prime(i):
            prime_list.append(i)
    return sorted(prime_list, reverse=True)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function has not been provided in the question, so it is assumed to be a pre-defined function that checks if an integer is prime or not. Similarly, the `is_right_truncatable_prime` function has also not been provided, so it is also assumed to be a pre-defined function that checks if an integer is a right-truncatable prime number or not.
