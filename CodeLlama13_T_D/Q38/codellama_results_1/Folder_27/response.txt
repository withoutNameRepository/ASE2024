```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 56])
```
This is a straightforward implementation of the problem statement. We first generate all subsets of `elements` using the built-in `powerset()` function, and then filter out all subsets that are not of size 56 using list comprehension. Finally, we return the length of this filtered subset.

Note that this solution assumes that `elements` is a set data structure containing unique elements. If it is a list or any other iterable data structure, you may need to use `set(elements)` before passing it to the function.
