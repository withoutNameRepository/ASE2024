```
def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(set) if len(subset) == 72])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns all possible subsets of a given set. The code then filters this list to include only subsets of size 72 and returns the length of the filtered list.
