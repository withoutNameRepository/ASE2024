```
def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(set) if len(subset) == 87])
```
This function uses the `powerset` built-in function to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters out the subsets that have a size different from 87. The length of the resulting list is returned as the number of all subsets of size 87.
