```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 69])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the power set of `elements`, and returns the number of subsets that have length 69. The `powerset` function is not defined here, but it can be found in various places online or implemented separately as needed.
