```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of the input set `elements`, and then filters out the subsets that have a length other than `n`. The resulting list is then passed to the `len()` function to get the number of filtered subsets.
