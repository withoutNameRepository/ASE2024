def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 41])

# Use the built-in function 'powerset' to generate all subsets of a set.
def powerset(s):
    x = len(s)
    masks = [1 << i for i in range(x)]
    for i in range(1 << x):
        yield [s[j] for j in range(x) if i & (1 << j)]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of the input set `elements` and then filters them by size using `len`. The resulting subset is then returned as a length.

The `powerset` function generates all subsets of a given set using bit masks and a for loop. It is a built-in Python function that can be used directly in your code without modification.
