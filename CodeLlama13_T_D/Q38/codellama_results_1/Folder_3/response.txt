```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([x for x in powerset(elements) if len(x) == 100])
```
Here, `powerset` is a function that returns the power set of a given set, i.e., all possible subsets of the set. We use a list comprehension to iterate over all elements of the power set, and count the number of elements whose length is equal to 100.
