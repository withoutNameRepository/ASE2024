```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in subsets(elements) if len(subset) == 10])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all the subsets of `elements` and then filters them by checking their length. The resulting list is then converted to an iterator with the `iter()` function, which returns the number of elements in the iterable.
