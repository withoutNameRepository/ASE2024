```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return sum(len(set(e)) == 801 for e in subsets(elements))
```
This function uses the `subsets` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible subsets of the given set of elements, and then counts the number of subsets that have size 801. The solution is generated using a list comprehension.
