```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == n])

# Test the function with an example set of elements
elements = {1, 2, 3}
print(find_subset_of_length_n(elements, 19)) # Output: 0
```
Note that the `powerset` function is not defined in this code snippet, you can find its definition in other sources or implement it yourself.
