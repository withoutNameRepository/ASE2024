```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in subsets(elements) if len(subset) == 860])
```
This function uses the `subsets` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a given set, and then filters out those that are not of length 860. The resulting list is then converted into an integer using `len`.
