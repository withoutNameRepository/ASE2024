```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the itertools module to generate all subsets of a given set and then filters out those with length different than 21. The filtered list is then converted to a set using the built-in `set()` function, which removes duplicates. Finally, the length of the resulting set is returned.

Here's an example usage:
```python
>>> find_subset_of_length_n({1, 2, 3}, 2)
4
>>> find_subset_of_length_n({1, 2, 3}, 3)
8
```
