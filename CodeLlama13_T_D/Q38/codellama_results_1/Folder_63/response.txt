```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a given set and then filters them based on their size. The number of elements in each filtered subset is counted using `len`, which returns the length of the list, i.e., the number of elements.
