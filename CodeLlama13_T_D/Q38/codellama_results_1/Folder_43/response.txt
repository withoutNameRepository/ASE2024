```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 29])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets with length 29. The resulting list is then passed to `len()` to get the number of elements in the filtered list.
