```
def find_subset_of_length_n(my_set, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(my_set) if len(s) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset()` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a set. The solution then filters this list to only include subsets with size equal to `n`, and returns the length of that filtered list as the number of subsets of size `n`.
