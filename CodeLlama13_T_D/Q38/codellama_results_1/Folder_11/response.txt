```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 77])
```
Here is an explanation of the code:

The `powerset` function generates all subsets of a given set. In this case, it takes the argument `elements`, which is a set of elements, and returns a list of all its subsets.

The `find_subset_of_length_n` function then filters through the resulting list to find only those subsets that have size 77. The length of each subset is checked using the `len` built-in function.

Finally, the number of such subsets is returned using the `len` function on the filtered list.
