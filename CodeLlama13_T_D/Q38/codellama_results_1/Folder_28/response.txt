```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function to generate all subsets of the input set and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets with length 37. The length of this filtered list is returned as the final result.
