```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 4])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the power set of `elements` and count the number of subsets of size 4. The resulting length of the list is returned as the answer.
