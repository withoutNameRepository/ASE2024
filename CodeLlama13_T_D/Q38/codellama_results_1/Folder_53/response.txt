def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([i for i in range(1, 2**len(elements)) if bin(i).count('1') == n])
```
This function uses the binary representation of a number to count the number of subsets of size `n`. It generates all possible combinations of elements and counts the number of ones in their binary representation. The resulting list is then converted to a set to remove duplicates.
