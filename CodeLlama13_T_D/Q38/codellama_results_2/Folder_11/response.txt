Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'find_subset_of_length_n' that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 77.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution without any explanation.
