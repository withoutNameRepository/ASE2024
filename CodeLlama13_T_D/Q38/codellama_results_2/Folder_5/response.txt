```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the power set of `elements` and counts the number of subsets that have length equal to `n`. The result is returned as an integer.
