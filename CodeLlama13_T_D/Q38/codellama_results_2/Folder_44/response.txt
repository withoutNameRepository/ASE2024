```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == 30])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the itertools module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters out the ones with size 30 using a list comprehension. The length of the resulting list is returned as the final answer.
