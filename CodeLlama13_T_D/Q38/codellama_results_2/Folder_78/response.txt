```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the itertools library to generate all subsets of a set and then filters out the subsets that are not of size 91. The length of this list is then returned as the number of subsets.
