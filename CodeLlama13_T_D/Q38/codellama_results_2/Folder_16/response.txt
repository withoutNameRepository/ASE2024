```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 327])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters those subsets to keep only the ones with size equal to 327. The result is then returned as a list.
