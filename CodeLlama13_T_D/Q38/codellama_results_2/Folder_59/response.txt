```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 2])
```
Please note that this solution relies on a function `powerset()` which is not defined in the text specification. However, it can be easily implemented using recursion as follows:
```
def powerset(iterable):
    s = list(iterable)
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))
```
