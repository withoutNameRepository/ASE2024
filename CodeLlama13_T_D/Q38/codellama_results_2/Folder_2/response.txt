```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the built-in `powerset` function to generate all subsets of `elements`, and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets with length equal to `n`. The number of elements in this filtered list is then returned.
