```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function to generate all subsets of a given set, and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets of size `n`. The length of this filtered list is returned as the number of all its subsets of size `n`.
