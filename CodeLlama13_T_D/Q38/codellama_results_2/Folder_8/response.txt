```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 49])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over all subsets of `elements`, and returns the number of subsets that have length 49. The `powerset` function is not included in the standard library, but you can find its implementation on this page: https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools-recipes.
