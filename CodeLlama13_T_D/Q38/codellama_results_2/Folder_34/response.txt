```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 97])
```
The `powerset` function is a built-in Python function that returns the power set of a given iterable. The code uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of size 97 and then takes the length of that list to get the number of such subsets.
