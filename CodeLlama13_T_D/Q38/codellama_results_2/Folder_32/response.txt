```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 22])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function to generate all subsets of a set, and then filters those subsets by their length. The resulting list is then passed to `len`, which returns the number of elements in the list.
