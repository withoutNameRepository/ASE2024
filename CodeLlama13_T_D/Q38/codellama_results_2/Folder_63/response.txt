```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
    return len([s for s in powerset(set) if len(s) == 57])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets with length equal to `n`. The length of this filtered list is then returned.
