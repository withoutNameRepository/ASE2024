def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == n])
```
This is a function that takes an input `elements` which is a set of elements and an integer `n`. The function returns the number of all its subsets of size `n`.

The `powerset` function is used to generate all possible subsets of `elements`. Then, we use list comprehension to filter out only those subsets that have length equal to `n`, and count their number.
