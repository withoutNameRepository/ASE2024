```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 41])
```
Here, `powerset` is a function that returns the power set of a given set. The power set of a set is the set of all its subsets. The code first generates the power set of the input set using `powerset`. Then, it filters the power set to find the subsets of size 41 and returns their number using `len`.
