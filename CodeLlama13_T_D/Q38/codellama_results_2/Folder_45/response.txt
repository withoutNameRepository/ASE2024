```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in subsets(elements) if len(subset) == n])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    elements = {'a', 'b', 'c'}
    print(find_subset_of_length_n(elements))
```
This code defines a function `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes a set of elements and returns the number of all its subsets of size 33. The function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of the input set, filters out those with length different from 33, and finally computes the length of the remaining subset.

The `subsets` function is not defined in this code. It should be provided by you or imported from an external library.
