```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 37])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all the subsets of `elements` and then filters them by checking if their length is equal to 37. The resulting subset is then converted back into an integer using `len()`.
