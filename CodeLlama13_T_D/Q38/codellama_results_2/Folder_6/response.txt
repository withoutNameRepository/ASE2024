```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the standard library to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters those that have a length equal to `n`. Finally, it returns the number of such subsets.
