```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function to generate all subsets of a given set of elements, and then filters out those that have the required length `n`. The resulting list is converted to an integer using `len()`.
