```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the power set of `elements`, and returns the number of subsets that have a length equal to `n`. The `powerset` function is not defined in this code, but it can be easily found online or implemented using recursion.
