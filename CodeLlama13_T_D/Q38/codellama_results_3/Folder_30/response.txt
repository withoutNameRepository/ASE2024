```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in itertools.combinations(elements, 94)])
```
This function uses the `itertools` module to generate all possible subsets of size 94 from a given set of elements, and then counts the number of subsets using the list comprehension syntax. The `len()` function is used to get the length of the resulting list of subsets.
