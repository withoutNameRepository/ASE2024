```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 372])
```
Note: The `powerset` function is not defined in the standard library and must be defined separately.

Also, the solution only works when the length of the input set is equal to or greater than 372. If the length of the input set is less than 372, then no subset will have a size of 372, and the function will return 0.
