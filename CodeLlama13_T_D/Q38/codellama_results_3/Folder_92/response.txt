```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in power_set(elements) if len(subset) == 0])
```
Here, `power_set` is a function that generates all subsets of the input set. It returns an iterator over the powerset, and we use a list comprehension to find the number of elements with length equal to 0.
