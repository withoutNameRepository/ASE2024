```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 24])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters out the ones that are not of size 24. The length of this filtered list is returned as the answer.
