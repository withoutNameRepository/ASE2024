```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 77])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters out those that are not of size 77. The length of the resulting list is returned as the number of all its subsets of size 77.
