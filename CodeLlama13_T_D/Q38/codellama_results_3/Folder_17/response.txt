```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This is a function named `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes two arguments: `elements`, which is a set of elements, and `n`, which is the size of the subsets to be counted. The function returns the number of all its subsets of size `n`.

The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the power set of `elements` and count the number of subsets that have length `n`. It then returns this value.

Note: This solution assumes that you have already implemented a function called `powerset` that generates the power set of a set. If you don't have such a function, you can find it in many places on the internet or write your own implementation.
