```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 894])
```
The `powerset` function is a built-in function in Python that returns the power set of a given set. The `len` function is used to count the number of elements in the list comprehension.
