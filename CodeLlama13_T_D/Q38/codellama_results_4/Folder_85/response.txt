```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([sub for sub in subsets(elements) if len(sub) == n])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all the subsets of `elements` and then filters them by their length using the `len()` built-in function. The resulting list is then passed to the `len()` function to get the number of elements in it, which is the number of subsets of size `n`.
