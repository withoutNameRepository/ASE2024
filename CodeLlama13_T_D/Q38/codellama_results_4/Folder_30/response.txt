```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(my_set):
    return sum(1 << i for i in range(len(my_set)))
```
This function uses the bitwise left shift operator to generate all possible subsets of a set with size `len(my_set)`. The number of such subsets is equal to 2^`len(my_set)`, which is returned by the sum.
