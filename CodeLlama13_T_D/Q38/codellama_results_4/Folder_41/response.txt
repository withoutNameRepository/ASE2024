```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == 84])
```
The `powerset` function is a helper function that generates all possible subsets of the input set. The outer list comprehension filters the results to only include subsets with length 84, and then returns the count of these subsets using `len`.
