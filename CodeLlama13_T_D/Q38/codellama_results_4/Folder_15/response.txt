<code>powerset</code> is a function that returns the power set of a given set. The power set of a set A is the set of all subsets of A. It can be defined recursively as follows:
```
def powerset(A):
    if len(A) == 0:
        return [[]]
    else:
        B = A[1:]
        return [[A[0]] + b for b in powerset(B)] + powerset(B)
```
