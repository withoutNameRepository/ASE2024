```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 90])
```
This code uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of `elements`, and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets with length 90. The `len` function is used to count the number of such subsets.
