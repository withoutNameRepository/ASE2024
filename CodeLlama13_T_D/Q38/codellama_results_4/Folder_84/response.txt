```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([s for s in subsets(elements) if len(s) == 872])

def subsets(elements):
    if not elements:
        yield []
    else:
        for i, e in enumerate(elements):
            for s in subsets(elements[i+1:]):
                yield [e] + s
```
Note: This code uses the `subsets` function from the standard library, which is not included in this example.
