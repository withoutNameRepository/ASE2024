```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 372])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all subsets of `elements` and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets with length 372. The final step is to count the number of elements in this filtered list using the `len()` function.
