```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == 27])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters out those that do not have size 27. The result is then returned as a list of subsets.
