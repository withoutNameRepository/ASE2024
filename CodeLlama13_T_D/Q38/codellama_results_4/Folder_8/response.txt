```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(set):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(set) if len(subset) == 49])
```
Here, `powerset` is a function that returns the power set of a given set. The power set of a set `S` is the set of all subsets of `S`. In other words, it contains all possible combinations of elements from `S`, including the empty set and `S` itself.

The solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the power set of the input set, and returns the number of subsets that have size 49. The `len()` function is used to count the number of items in the resulting list.
