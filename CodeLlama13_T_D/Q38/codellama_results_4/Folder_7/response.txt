```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters the resulting list to only include subsets of size `n`. The length of this filtered list is returned.
