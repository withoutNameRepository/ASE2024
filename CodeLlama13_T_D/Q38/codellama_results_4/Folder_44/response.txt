```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    # Initialize a set to store all subsets of size 30
    subsets = set()

    # Iterate over each element in the input set
    for element in elements:
        # Check if the current element is already present in any subset
        if element not in subsets:
            # If not, add the current element to all existing subsets of size 30
            for subset in subsets:
                subsets.add(subset | {element})
        else:
            # If the current element is already present, remove it from all existing subsets of size 30
            for subset in subsets:
                subsets.remove(subset - {element})

    # Return the number of subsets of size 30
    return len(subsets)
```
Note that this solution uses the `|` operator to add elements to sets and the `-` operator to remove elements from sets, which is not a standard Python operation. However, it is a common convention in mathematics and computer science to use these operators to represent set union and difference respectively.
