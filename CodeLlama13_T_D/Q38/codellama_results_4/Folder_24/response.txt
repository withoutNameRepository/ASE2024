```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the standard library to generate all subsets of a set, and then filters those subsets by size using list comprehension. The `len()` function is used to count the number of elements in each subset, and the resulting list is returned as an integer value.
