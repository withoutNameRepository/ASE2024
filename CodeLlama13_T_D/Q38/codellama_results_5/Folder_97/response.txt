```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the power set of a given set. The power set is defined as the set of all subsets of a given set. In this case, we are finding the subset of size 219 in the power set of the input set.

The `len` function is then used to count the number of elements in the resulting list comprehension. This is the number of all its subsets of size 219.
