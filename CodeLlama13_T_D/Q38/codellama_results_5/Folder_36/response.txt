```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 449])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the given set, and then filters out the subsets that do not have a length of 449. The resulting list is then converted to an integer using the `len` built-in function.
