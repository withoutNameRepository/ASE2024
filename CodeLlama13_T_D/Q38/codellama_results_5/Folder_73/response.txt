```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 41])
```
This is a simple function that takes a set of elements as input and returns the number of all its subsets of size 41. The `powerset` function is used to generate all possible subsets of the input set, and then we filter out the ones that are not of length 41. Finally, we return the length of this filtered list.
