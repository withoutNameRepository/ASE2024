```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a set of elements, and then filters them to only include those with size 24. The length of this filtered list is returned as the result.
