```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(set_of_elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(set_of_elements) if len(subset) == 860])
```
This code defines a function `find_subset_of_length_n` that takes one argument, a set of elements, and returns the number of all its subsets of size 860. The function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all subsets of the input set with length 860, and then returns the length of this list.

The `powerset` function is not defined in the code snippet you provided, so I assume it is a built-in function that returns the power set of a given set.
