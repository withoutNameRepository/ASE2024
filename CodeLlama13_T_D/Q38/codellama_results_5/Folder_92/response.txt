```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the Python standard library to generate all subsets of the input set `elements`. It then filters this list to only include subsets with size `n`, and returns the length of this filtered list.
