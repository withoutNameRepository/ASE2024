def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(elements) if len(s) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` method to generate all subsets of the input set `elements`, and then filters out any subset that is not of size 22. Finally, it returns the length of this filtered list as the number of all its subsets of size 22.
