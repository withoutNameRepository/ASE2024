```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 8])
```
The `powerset` function is a built-in Python function that returns the power set of a given iterable. In this case, it's used to generate all subsets of the input elements. The list comprehension then filters out any subset with size different from 8, and the length of the resulting list is returned as the answer.
