[INST: How do I format my text to make it appear as code?]  You can format your text as code by surrounding it with triple backticks. This will cause the text to be displayed in a fixed-width font and with syntax highlighting, if available. For example:
```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == 42])
```
