```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in power_set(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
Note: The `power_set` function is not included in this solution, but it can be easily implemented using the following code:
```
def power_set(elements):
    result = [[]]
    for element in elements:
        result += [subset + [element] for subset in result]
    return result
```
