```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([subset for subset in powset(elements) if len(subset) == 2])
```
This function uses the `powset` function to get all subsets of a set, and then filters the resulting list using a list comprehension to keep only subsets of size 2. The length of this filtered list is then returned.
