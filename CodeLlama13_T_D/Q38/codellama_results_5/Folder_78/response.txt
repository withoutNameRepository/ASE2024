```
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    # Initialize a variable to store the result
    result = 0
    
    # Iterate over all possible subsets of size n
    for subset in powerset(elements, n=91):
        # Increment the result by 1 for each subset found
        result += 1
        
    # Return the result
    return result
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible subsets of size `n` in a set. It then iterates over these subsets and increments a counter for each subset found, returning the final value of the counter as the number of all its subsets of size `91`.
