```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements, n):
    return len([subset for subset in powerset(elements) if len(subset) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of `elements`, and then filters out the ones that have length different than `n`. The length of the resulting list is returned.
