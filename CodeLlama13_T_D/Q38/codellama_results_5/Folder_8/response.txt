```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([
        subset for subset in subsets(elements) if len(subset) == 49
    ])
```
This function uses the `subsets` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters out the ones that are not of size 49. The length of the resulting list is returned as the number of subsets of size 49.
