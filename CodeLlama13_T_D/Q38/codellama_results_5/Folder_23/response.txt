```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(my_set, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(my_set) if len(s) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set and then filters them by their length. The resulting list is then cast as a set, which will remove any duplicates. Finally, the length of this resulting set is returned.
