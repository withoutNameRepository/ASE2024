```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(my_set, n):
    return len([s for s in powerset(my_set) if len(s) == n])
```
This function uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of a set and then counts the number of subsets that have length equal to `n`. The `len()` function is used to get the final count.
