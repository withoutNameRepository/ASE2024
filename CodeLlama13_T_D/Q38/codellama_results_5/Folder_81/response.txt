```python
def find_subset_of_length_n(elements):
    return len([x for x in powerset(elements) if len(x) == 20])
```
This code uses the `powerset` function from the `itertools` module to generate all subsets of the input set, and then filters the resulting list to only include elements with length 20. The final step is to return the length of this filtered list.
