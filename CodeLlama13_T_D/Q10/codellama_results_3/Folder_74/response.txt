```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums if 13 < x < 70 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This is a Python function that takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the odd integers between indices 13 and 70 (both exclusive). If no such odd integers exist in the input list, an empty list is returned. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and filter out any elements that are not odd or do not fall within the specified range.
