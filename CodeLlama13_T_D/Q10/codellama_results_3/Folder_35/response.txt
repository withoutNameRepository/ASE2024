```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 10 <= x < 79 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `my_list`, returning only the elements that are odd integers between indices 10 and 79, both exclusive. If no such elements exist in the list, an empty list is returned.
