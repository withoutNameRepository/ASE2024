def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 295 < x < 573 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This is a Python function called `all_odd_ints_exclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 295 to index 573, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `my_list` and selects only the elements that meet the condition of being an odd integer between indices 295 and 573, both exclusive. The selected elements are then returned as a new list.
