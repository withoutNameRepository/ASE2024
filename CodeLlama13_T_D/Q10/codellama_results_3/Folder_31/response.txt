```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[87:95] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and checks if each integer is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If an odd integer is found, it is included in the resulting list. The `[]` at the end of the list comprehension is used to specify that an empty list should be returned if no odd integers are found in the specified range.
