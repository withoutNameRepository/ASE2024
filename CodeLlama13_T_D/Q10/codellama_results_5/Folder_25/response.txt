```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[40:70] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over the slice of `my_list` from index 40 to 69, and checks whether each element is odd using the modulo operator. If an element is odd, it is included in the output list.
