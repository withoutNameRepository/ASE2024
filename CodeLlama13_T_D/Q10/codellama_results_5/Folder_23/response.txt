```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 29 <= x < 53 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `my_list`, and returns only the elements that meet the specified conditions of being odd integers between indices 29 and 53, both exclusive. If no such odd integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
