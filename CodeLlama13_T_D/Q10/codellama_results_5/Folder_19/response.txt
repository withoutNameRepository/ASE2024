```
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[2:6] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of odd integers from index 2 to index 5, both exclusive. The `if` clause is used to filter out any even numbers that may be present in the list. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Here's another way to write this function using a generator expression:
```
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[2:6] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses the same logic as the previous one, but it returns a generator instead of a list. This can be useful when you only need to iterate over the odd integers and don't want to create a full list in memory.
