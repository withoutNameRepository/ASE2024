```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 93 < x < 94 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and returns only those that are odd and in the range from index 93 to index 94, both exclusive. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
