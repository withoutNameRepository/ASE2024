```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[8:9] if x % 2 == 1] or []
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing all the odd integers between indices 8 and 9, both exclusive. If no odd integer is found in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The code uses a list comprehension to select the elements from the input list that satisfy the condition `x % 2 == 1`, and then uses the `or` operator to handle the case where the list is empty.

For example, if we call the function with the argument `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, it will return `[9]`. If we call it with the argument `[2, 4, 6, 8]`, it will return an empty list.
