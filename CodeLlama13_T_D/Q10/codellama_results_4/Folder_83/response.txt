```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 90 < x < 200 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of odd integers from the input list. The condition `x % 2 == 1` is used to filter out even numbers, and the conditions `90 < x < 200` are used to select only the desired range of indices. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
