def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 78 < x < 93 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list with only the odd integers from index 78 to index 93, both exclusive. The `if` condition checks that the current element is an odd integer and falls within the specified range.
