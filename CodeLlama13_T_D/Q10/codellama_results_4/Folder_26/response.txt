```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 != 0 and 44 < x < 79]
```
This code defines a function called `all_odd_ints_exclusive` that takes one argument, `my_list`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function returns a new list containing all the odd integers from index 44 to index 78 (both exclusive). If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

The code uses list comprehension to create the output list. It iterates over `my_list` and checks if each element is an odd integer and falls within the specified range. If both conditions are met, the element is added to the output list. The final result is returned as a list.
