```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 1 and 0 < x <= 3]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of odd integers from the input list, using the conditions specified in the problem statement. The `and` operator is used to ensure that both conditions are met for each element in the list.
