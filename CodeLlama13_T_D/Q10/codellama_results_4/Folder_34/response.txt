```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[59:201] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that returns only the odd integers from index 60 to index 200, both exclusive. The `if` clause ensures that only odd integers are included in the result. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
