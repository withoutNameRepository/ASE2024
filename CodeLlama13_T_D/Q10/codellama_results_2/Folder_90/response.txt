def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 389 < x < 748 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This code defines a function called `all_odd_ints_exclusive` that takes a list of integers as its only argument. The function returns the list of all odd integers from index 389 to index 748, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

The code uses a list comprehension to generate the output list based on the input list and the specified range. The `if` clause in the list comprehension checks if the current element is within the specified range and if it's odd. If both conditions are true, the current element is included in the output list.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
result = all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list)
print(result)  # Output: [5, 7]
```
