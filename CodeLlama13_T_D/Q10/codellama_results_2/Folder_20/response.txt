```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 1 and 59 <= x < 93]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and select only those that are odd numbers between indices 59 and 93, both exclusive. The resulting list is returned if any odd integers exist in the specified range, otherwise an empty list is returned.
