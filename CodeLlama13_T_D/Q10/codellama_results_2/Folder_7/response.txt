```
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 323 and x < 972]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, returning only those that are odd, greater than or equal to 323, and less than 972. The resulting list is returned if any such elements exist, otherwise an empty list is returned.
