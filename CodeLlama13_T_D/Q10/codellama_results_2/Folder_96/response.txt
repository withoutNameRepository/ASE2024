```
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 50 < x < 200 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and returns only the odd integers that fall between indices 50 and 200, both exclusive. If no such integer exists in the range, an empty list is returned.
