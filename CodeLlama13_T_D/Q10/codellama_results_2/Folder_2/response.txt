```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 36 < x < 52 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of `my_list` and selects those that are odd numbers between 36 and 52, both exclusive. The resulting list is returned. If no such elements exist, an empty list is returned.
