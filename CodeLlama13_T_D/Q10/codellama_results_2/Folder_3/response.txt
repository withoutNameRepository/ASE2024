    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 != 0 and 78 <= x < 93]
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of odd integers from the input list, with the specified range. The `and` keyword is used to ensure that both conditions are met for an element to be included in the output list.
