```
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 10 <= x < 80 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and include only those that are odd and fall within the specified range (exclusive). The resulting list is returned. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
