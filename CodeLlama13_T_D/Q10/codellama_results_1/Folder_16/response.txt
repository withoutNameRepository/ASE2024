```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[86:90] if x % 2 == 1]
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to create the new list of odd integers. The `if x % 2 == 1` condition is applied to each element in the list, and only those elements for which the condition is true are included in the output list.
