```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums if x % 2 != 0 and 15 < x < 99]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `nums` and selects only those elements that are odd numbers between indices 15 and 99, inclusive. The resulting list is then returned. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
