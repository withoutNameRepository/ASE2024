    return [i for i in my_list[5:9] if i % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of odd integers from the specified range. The `if` clause checks whether each integer is an odd number, and only those that are are included in the resulting list. If no odd numbers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
