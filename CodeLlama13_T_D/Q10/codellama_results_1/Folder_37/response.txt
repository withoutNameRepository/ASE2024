def all_odd_ints_exclusive(nums):
    return [num for num in nums[1:-1] if num % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and extract all odd integers from index 1 to index 2, both exclusive. The `nums[1:-1]` syntax selects all elements in the list except for the first and last element, which are used as an inclusive range for the output.
