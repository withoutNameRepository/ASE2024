Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_odd_ints_exclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all odd integers from index 0 to index 7, both exclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
