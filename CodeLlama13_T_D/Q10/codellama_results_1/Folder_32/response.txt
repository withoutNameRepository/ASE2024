```python
def all_odd_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 11 < x < 76 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to select the odd integers from index 11 to index 76, both exclusive. The `if` condition inside the list comprehension checks whether each integer is an odd number between the given indices, and only those that meet this condition are included in the output list. If no odd integers exist within the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
