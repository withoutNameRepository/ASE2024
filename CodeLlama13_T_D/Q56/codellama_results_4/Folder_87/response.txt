```python
def all_substring_of_size_n(s):
    n = 58
    substrings = []
    for i in range(len(s) - n + 1):
        substring = s[i:i+n]
        if len(set(substring)) == n and all(substring.count(c) == 1 for c in substring):
            substrings.append(substring)
    return substrings
```
Please note that this solution uses a set to keep track of the characters in each substring, which allows it to detect duplicate characters quickly. Additionally, the `all()` function is used to check if all characters in the substring appear only once.
