def all_substring_of_size_n(string, n):
    substrings = []
    for i in range(len(string) - (n - 1)):
        substring = string[i:i+n]

This function uses a set to keep track of the unique characters in each substring, and it checks that the length of the substring is equal to `n` before adding it to the list. It also checks that the substring does not contain any duplicates by checking if it is already present in the list of substrings.
