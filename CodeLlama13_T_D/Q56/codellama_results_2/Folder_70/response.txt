```python
def all_substring_of_size_n(string, n):
    substrings = []
    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):
        substring = string[i:i+n]
        if not any(substring[j] == substring[j-1] for j in range(1, len(substring))):
            substrings.append(substring)
    return substrings
```
This code defines a function called `all_substring_of_size_n` that takes two arguments: the first is a string and the second is an integer representing the size of each substring. The function returns a list of all distinct substrings of the given length with no duplicate characters, or an empty list if there are no such substrings in the given string.

The implementation uses a loop to iterate over the indices of the string, starting from 0 and ending at `len(string) - n + 1`. For each index `i`, it extracts a substring of length `n` using slicing notation, with the start index being `i` and the end index being `i+n`.

The function then checks if this substring is unique by checking if there are any duplicate characters. If not, it appends the substring to the list of substrings returned by the function. Finally, it returns the list of substrings.
