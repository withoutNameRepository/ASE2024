```python
def all_substring_of_size_n(s):
    return ["".join(x) for x in zip(*[iter(s)]*78)]
```
This function uses the `zip` function with an iterable argument to group 78 characters from the input string into tuples. Each tuple is then joined back into a string using the `"".join()` method, and the resulting list of strings is returned.
