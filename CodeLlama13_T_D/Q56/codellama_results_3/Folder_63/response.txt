```python
def all_substring_of_size_n(string, n):
    substrings = []
    for i in range(len(string) - n + 1):
        substring = string[i:i+n]
        if len(set(substring)) == n and not any(substring in s for s in substrings):
            substrings.append(substring)
    return substrings
```
The function `all_substring_of_size_n` takes a string as input and returns the list of all distinct substrings of length `n`. The function uses a nested loop to iterate over each substring of length `n` in the given string. For each substring, it checks if it does not contain any duplicate characters by using the `set()` method. If the substring is valid, it is added to the list of substrings. Finally, the function returns the list of substrings.

Note: The `len(set(substring))` check ensures that the substring does not contain any duplicates and the `not any(substring in s for s in substrings)` check ensures that the substring has not already been added to the list of substrings.
