```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum(x for x in my_list if 18 <= x <= 60)
```
This is a concise and efficient way to solve the problem. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all integers that meet the condition specified by the `if` clause, which checks whether each integer in the list falls between 18 and 60, both inclusive. If no such integers are found, the `sum` function returns 0 as expected.
