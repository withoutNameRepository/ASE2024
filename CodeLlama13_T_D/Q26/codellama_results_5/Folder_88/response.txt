```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if 1 <= x <= 7])
```
This is a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 1 and 7, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out elements that are not in the range [1, 7] and then applies the `sum` function to the resulting list.
