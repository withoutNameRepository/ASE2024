```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if 19 <= x <= 32])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are between 19 and 32, both inclusive. It then uses the `sum` function to calculate the total of these integers. If the given list does not contain any integers in this range, the result will be 0.
