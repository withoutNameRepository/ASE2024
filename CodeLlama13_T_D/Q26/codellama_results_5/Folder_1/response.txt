```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if -97 <= x <= -48])
```
Note: The `sum()` function is used to compute the sum of the elements in a list, and the comprehension `[x for x in my_list if -97 <= x <= -48]` is used to filter the elements in the list that are between `-97` and `-48`, both inclusive.
