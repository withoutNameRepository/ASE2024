    result = 0

```
[SYS]  This code defines a function called `sum_in_range` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all integers in the list that are between -91 and -61, both inclusive. If there are no such integers in the list, the function returns 0.

The function uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the input list. For each element, the function checks if it is between -91 and -61 using the `<= num <= -61` syntax. If the condition is true, the function adds the current element to the result variable using the `result += num` statement.

The function returns the final value of the result variable as its output.
