```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in my_list:
        if -355 <= i <= -297:
            result += i
    return result
```
Note that this solution uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers between -355 and -297, and then sums up the elements of that list using the built-in `sum()` function.
