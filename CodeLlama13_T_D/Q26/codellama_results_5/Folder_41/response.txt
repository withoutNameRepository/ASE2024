def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum(x for x in numbers if 2 <= x <= 4)
```
This is a simple example of a generator expression, which is a concise way to write a loop that generates a sequence of values. The `sum()` function takes an iterable and returns the sum of all the elements in it. In this case, the generator expression `x for x in numbers if 2 <= x <= 4` is used to generate a list of integers from `numbers` that are between 2 and 4, both inclusive. The `sum()` function then adds up all these values. If no such integer exists in `numbers`, `sum()` returns 0.
