```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum(x for x in my_list if 5 <= x <= 7)
```
This function uses a generator expression with the `sum()` function to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and check if they are between 5 and 7, both inclusive. If such integers are found, their sum is returned, otherwise 0 is returned.
