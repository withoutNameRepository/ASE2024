def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: x >= 4 and x <= 5, numbers))
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers in that list that are between 4 and 5 (both inclusive). The `filter()` function is used to filter out any integers that do not meet the condition. The `sum()` function is then used to compute the sum of the filtered list. If no such integers are found, the function returns 0.
