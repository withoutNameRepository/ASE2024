def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if 60 <= x <= 97])
```
This is a function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all elements in the list that are between 60 and 97, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the list, the function will return `0`.
