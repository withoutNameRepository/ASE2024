```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if 2 <= x <= 3])
```
This function first filters the input list using a list comprehension to keep only elements between 2 and 3, both inclusive. Then it uses `sum()` to calculate the sum of these elements. If no such elements are found, the function returns 0.
