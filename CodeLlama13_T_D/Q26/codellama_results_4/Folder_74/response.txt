```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list if 13 <= i <= 35)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers from the given list that are between 13 and 35, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to compute the sum of this new list. If there are no such integers in the given list, the resulting list will be empty, and the `sum()` function will return 0.
