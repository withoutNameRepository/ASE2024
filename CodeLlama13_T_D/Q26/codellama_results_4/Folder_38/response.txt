```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if 44 <= x <= 67])
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements between 44 and 67, both inclusive. The `sum` function is used to compute the sum of the filtered list, which is generated using a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions). If no elements in the input list are between 44 and 67, the function returns `0`.
