```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list if -616 <= i <= -205)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are between -616 and -205, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of all elements in this list. If the given list does not contain any such integers, the function will return 0.
