Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'get_unique_elements' that takes one argument, a list of strings, and returns a new list containing only the unique elements from the given list. If two or more elements are equal, they should be considered unique.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution without any explanation.
