```python
def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: -993 <= x <= -51, numbers)) or 0
```
This is a function called `sum_in_range` that takes one argument, a list of integers. It returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between `-993` and `-51`, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, it will return 0.

The function first uses `filter` to keep only the integers in the list that are between the desired range, and then uses `sum` to calculate the sum of those numbers. Finally, it returns either the sum or 0 if the list is empty.
