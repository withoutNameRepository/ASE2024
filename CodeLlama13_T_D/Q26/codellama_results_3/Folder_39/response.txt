```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([i for i in my_list if 10 <= i <= 79])
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and uses a list comprehension to create a new list of all elements from the original list that are between 10 and 79, both inclusive. It then returns the sum of this new list using the `sum` function. If no such integers exist in the list, it will return 0.
