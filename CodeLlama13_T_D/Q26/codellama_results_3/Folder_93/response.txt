def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list if -23 <= i <= 64)
```
This is a function that takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between -23 and 64, both inclusive. If the list does not contain such integers, the function returns 0. The code uses a generator expression to filter the list for values within the specified range, and then calls `sum()` on the filtered list to compute its sum.
