```
def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum([num for num in numbers if 32 <= num <= 44])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are between 32 and 44, both inclusive. The `sum` function is then used to compute the total of these numbers. If no such numbers exist in the given list, the function returns 0.
