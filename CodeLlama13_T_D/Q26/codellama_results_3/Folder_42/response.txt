```
def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: 141 <= x <= 262, numbers))
```
This function uses the `filter()` function to filter out all integers from the given list that are not between 141 and 262, both inclusive. The filtered list is then passed to the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of its elements.
