Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'sum_in_range' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers from the given list that are between 72 and 93, both inclusive. If the given list does not contain such integers, the function should return 0.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution without any explanation.
