```
def sum_in_range(nums):
    return sum(i for i in nums if 4 <= i <= 9)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of all integers from `nums` that are between 4 and 9, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of this new list. If there are no such integers in `nums`, the function returns 0.

Note: This solution uses a generator expression instead of a traditional list comprehension. A generator expression creates an iterator that yields each value in the sequence, rather than creating a full list in memory. This can be more efficient for large lists, as it avoids the overhead of creating and storing the entire list. However, in this case it is unlikely to make a significant difference.
