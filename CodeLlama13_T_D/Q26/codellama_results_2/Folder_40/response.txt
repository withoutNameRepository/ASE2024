```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    result = 0
    for num in my_list:
        if -9 <= num <= -7:
            result += num
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements that are between -9 and -7, both inclusive. If there are no such elements in the list, it returns 0. The code uses a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list and checks each element against the specified range using the "<=" and ">=" operators. If an element falls within the range, its value is added to the result using the "+=" operator.
