```python
def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum(n for n in numbers if 18 <= n <= 60)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter the numbers in the input list, and then uses the `sum()` built-in function to calculate the sum of the filtered numbers. The `if` clause in the list comprehension checks if each number is between 18 and 60 (both inclusive), and only includes those numbers in the result. If there are no such numbers in the input list, the function returns 0.
