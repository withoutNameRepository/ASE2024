```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum(x for x in my_list if 19 <= x <= 32) or 0
```
Note that this function uses a generator expression to extract the integers from the list that are between 19 and 32, both inclusive. The `sum` function is then used to compute the sum of these extracted integers. If there are no such integers in the list, the generator expression will be empty, and the function will return 0.
