```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list if -3 <= x <= 6])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter the elements of `my_list` that are between `-3` and `6`, both inclusive, and then calculates the sum of those elements using the built-in `sum()` function. If there are no elements in this range, the function returns `0`.
