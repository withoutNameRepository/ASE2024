```python
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    result = 0
    for num in my_list:
        if -91 <= num <= -61:
            result += num
    return result
```
This is a basic function that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all elements between -91 and -61, both inclusive. If no such element is found, the function will return 0.
