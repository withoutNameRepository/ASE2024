```
def sum_in_range(my_list):
    return sum(x for x in my_list if 584 <= x <= 619) or 0
```
This function uses a list comprehension to select the elements of `my_list` that are between 584 and 619, both inclusive. It then sums these elements using the built-in `sum()` function. If no such elements exist in `my_list`, it returns 0 instead.
