```
def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum(n for n in numbers if 6 <= n <= 8) or 0
```
This is a concise and efficient solution using a list comprehension to filter the elements that are between 6 and 8, both inclusive, and then uses the `sum()` function to get the final result. If no such element exists in the list, it will return 0.
