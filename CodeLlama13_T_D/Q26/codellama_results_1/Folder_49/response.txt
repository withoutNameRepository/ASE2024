```python
def sum_in_range(numbers):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: 3 <= x <= 9, numbers))
```
This is a simple function that takes in a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers from the list that are between 3 and 9, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the filtered elements, and the `filter()` function is used to filter out any elements that are not within the specified range.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> sum_in_range(numbers)
39
```
As you can see, the function returns the correct sum of all integers from the list that are between 3 and 9, both inclusive.
