This code defines a function called `return_nth_smallest_ascii` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. The function returns the character with the 8th smallest ASCII value among those characters in the string that occur between indices 3 to 52, both inclusive.

The function first creates an empty list called `ascii_values` to store the ASCII values of the characters in the input string. Then it iterates over each character in the string using a for loop and checks if its ASCII value is between 3 and 52 (inclusive). If the condition is true, the function appends the ASCII value of the current character to `ascii_values`.

After all characters have been processed, the function sorts the list of ASCII values in ascending order using the built-in `sort()` method. Finally, it returns the 8th element of the sorted list (the 8th smallest ASCII value) as a character using the `chr()` function.
