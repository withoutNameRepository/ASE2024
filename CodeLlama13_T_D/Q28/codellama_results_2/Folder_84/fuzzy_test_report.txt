Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['r+iGp"58@WAm!dX3:a_IDnO>c*b\\B2(C&`^FJow/R<?-s\'[6Pgl~Yhv|%N]tQ7Lz.M={UxK,$fS u)1#yV']

The correct answer was:
.

But the LLM code returned:
1
