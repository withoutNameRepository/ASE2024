```python
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(s):
    return min([c for c in s[21:59+1] if ord(c) <= 122], key=ord)
```
This function first extracts the substring of characters from indices 21 to 59, both inclusive. It then uses a list comprehension to create a list of all characters in that substring that have an ASCII value less than or equal to 122 (i.e., the letter "z"). Finally, it uses the `min` function with the `key=ord` argument to find the character with the smallest ASCII value among those remaining characters.
