```
def return_nth_smallest_ascii(string):
    count = {}
    for i in range(5):
        if string[i] in count:
            count[string[i]] += 1
        else:
            count[string[i]] = 1
    nth_smallest = min(count, key=count.get)
    return nth_smallest
```
Note that this function only works for the first five characters of the string. If you need to find the nth smallest ASCII value for a larger number of characters, you would need to modify the code accordingly.
