```
def composite_nums_between_indices(list):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(list) if 55 <= i <= 98 and is_composite(x)}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to iterate over the indices of the list, and returns the composite numbers between index 55 and 98. The `is_composite` function is not defined in this example, but it could be implemented as follows:
```
def is_composite(n):
    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return True
    return False
```
