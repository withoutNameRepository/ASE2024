```
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if 43 <= i <= 51 and x > 1}
```
This is a concise solution using a set comprehension. The `enumerate()` function generates an enumerated list of the original list, with each element being a tuple containing the index and the value. The set comprehension then filters this list to only include elements that have indices between 43 and 51, both inclusive, and their values are greater than 1 (which indicates a composite number). Finally, the resulting set is returned.
