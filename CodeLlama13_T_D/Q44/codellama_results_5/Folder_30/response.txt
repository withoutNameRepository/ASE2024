```
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if 19 <= i <= 92 and x > 1}
```
This is a simple generator expression that iterates over the indices of the list `lst`, checking if the index is between 19 and 92 (both inclusive). If so, it checks if the corresponding element in the list (`x`) is greater than 1. If both conditions are met, the element is added to a set, which is then returned by the function.

Please note that this solution assumes that all elements in the list `lst` are positive integers. If there are any negative numbers or non-integer elements, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
