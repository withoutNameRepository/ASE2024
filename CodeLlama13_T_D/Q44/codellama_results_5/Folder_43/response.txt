```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if 31 <= i <= 72 and x > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all the composite numbers in `lst` between indices 31 and 72 (both inclusive). The `enumerate()` function is used to keep track of the index position, and the `if` condition checks if the current index is between 31 and 72 (inclusive), and if the current number is greater than 1. If no such composite numbers exist, an empty set is returned.
