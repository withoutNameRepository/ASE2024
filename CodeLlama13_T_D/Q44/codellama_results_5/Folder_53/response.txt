def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):
    return {num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if 222 <= i <= 222 and not is_prime(num)}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to generate the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between indices 222 and 222, both inclusive. The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime or not. If no composite number exists in the specified range, an empty set is returned.
