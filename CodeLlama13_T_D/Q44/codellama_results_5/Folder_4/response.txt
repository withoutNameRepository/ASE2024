Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'unique_even_nums' that takes one argument, an array of positive integers. The function should return the set of all unique even numbers in the given list. If no even number exists in the list, the function should return an empty set.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution without any explanation.
