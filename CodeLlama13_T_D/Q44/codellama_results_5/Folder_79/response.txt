```
def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if 6 <= i < 12 and x > 1}
```
Note: This solution uses a set comprehension to create the set of all composite numbers between indices 6 and 12 (both inclusive). It uses `enumerate` to get the index of each element in the list, and then checks if the index is within the specified range and if the number is greater than 1. If both conditions are met, the number is added to the set.
