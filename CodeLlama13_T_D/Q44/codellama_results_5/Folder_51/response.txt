def composite_nums_between_indices(list_of_positive_integers):
    return {x for x in list_of_positive_integers[1:8] if x > 1}
```
This is a one-line function that uses a set comprehension to create the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 1 and index 8, both inclusive. The `x for x in list_of_positive_integers[1:8]` part creates a set containing all elements from index 1 to index 8, while the `if x > 1` clause filters out any elements that are less than or equal to 1, which means they are not composite numbers.
