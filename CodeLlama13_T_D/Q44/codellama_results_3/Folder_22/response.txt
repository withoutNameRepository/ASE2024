```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    # find the indices of 50 and 200 in lst
    idx_50 = next((i for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x == 50), None)
    idx_200 = next((i for i, x in enumerate(lst) if x == 200), None)
    
    # find the composite numbers between indices 50 and 200
    composite_nums = [x for i, x in enumerate(lst[idx_50:idx_200+1]) if is_composite_number(x)]
    
    return set(composite_nums)
```
Note: This solution assumes that the input list `lst` contains only positive integers. If the list can contain negative integers, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
