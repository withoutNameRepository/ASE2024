def composite_nums_between_indices(list_of_ints):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(list_of_ints) if 686 <= i <= 987 and not is_prime(x)}
```
This solution uses a set comprehension to find all the composite numbers in the given list that are between indices 686 and 987, both inclusive. The `is_prime` function is used to check if a number is prime or not. If no composite number exists in the specified range, an empty set is returned.
