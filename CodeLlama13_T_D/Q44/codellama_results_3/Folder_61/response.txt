```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):
    composite_nums = []
    for i in range(8):
        if numbers[i] > 1 and numbers[i] <= len(numbers):
            composite_nums.append(numbers[i])
    return set(composite_nums)
```
The `composite_nums_between_indices` function takes a list of positive integers as an argument, and returns the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 0 to index 7, both inclusive. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices in the range of 0 to 7, and checks if each number is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the length of the input list. If a number meets these conditions, it is added to a new list called `composite_nums`. The function then returns the set of all composite numbers in the `composite_nums` list.
