```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(numbers) if 667 <= i <= 774 and x > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to filter the input list and only include elements that are composite numbers (i.e., greater than 1) between indices 667 and 774, both inclusive. The `enumerate` function is used to keep track of the index of each element in the list, which allows for easy filtering based on the desired range.
