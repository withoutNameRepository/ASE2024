```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if 29 <= i <= 93 and x > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all the composite numbers between indices 29 and 93, both inclusive. It does this by iterating over `enumerate(lst)`, which gives us a tuple of the index and value for each element in the list. We then filter out any elements that are not between indices 29 and 93, and only keep those whose values are greater than 1 (which implies they are composite). The resulting set of composite numbers is returned by the function.
