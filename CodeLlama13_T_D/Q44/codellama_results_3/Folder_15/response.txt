def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if 0 <= i < 4 and len(str(x)) > 1}
```
Note: This code uses a set comprehension to create the set of all composite numbers between index 0 and 3 in the given list. The `enumerate` function is used to keep track of the indices, and the condition `len(str(x)) > 1` is used to check if the number is composite (i.e., has more than one digit).
