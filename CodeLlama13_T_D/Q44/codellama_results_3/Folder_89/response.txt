```
def composite_nums_between_indices(list_of_positive_ints):
    return {num for i, num in enumerate(list_of_positive_ints) if 36 <= i <= 46 and num > 1}
```
Note: This solution uses a set comprehension to create the set of composite numbers between indices 36 and 46 (inclusive), where `num` is greater than 1.
