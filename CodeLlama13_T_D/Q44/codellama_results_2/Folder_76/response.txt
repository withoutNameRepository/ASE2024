```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):
    return {number for i, number in enumerate(numbers) if 639 <= i <= 975 and number > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to create a set of all the composite numbers between index 639 and index 975 (inclusive), based on the given list of positive integers. The condition `number > 1` ensures that only composite numbers are included in the set.
