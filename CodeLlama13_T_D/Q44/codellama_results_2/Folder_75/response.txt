```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {i for i in lst[75:86] if len(str(i)) > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to iterate over the list and check if each number is a composite number by checking its length. If it's longer than 1, it's a composite number and will be included in the result set.
