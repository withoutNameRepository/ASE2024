```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if 29 <= i <= 93 and x > 1}
```
This is a generator expression that creates a set of all composite numbers in the given list `lst` between indices 29 to 93 both inclusive. The condition `x > 1` ensures that only composite numbers are considered, since 1 is not a prime number. The function returns an empty set if no composite number exists in the specified range.
