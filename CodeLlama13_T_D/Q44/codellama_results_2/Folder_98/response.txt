def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if i >= 0 and i <= 6 and x > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all the composite numbers in the list between indices 0 and 6 (both inclusive). It first enumerates the list to create a tuple of (index, value) pairs. Then it filters out any pairs with an index that is not between 0 and 6, or where the value is not greater than 1. Finally, it returns the set of all values in the filtered list.
