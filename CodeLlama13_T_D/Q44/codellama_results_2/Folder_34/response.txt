```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(numbers) if 70 <= i <= 200 and x > 1}
```
This code creates a set comprehension that iterates over the `enumerate()` of the input list, and only includes elements where the index is between 70 and 200 (inclusive), and the element itself is greater than 1 (i.e., composite). The resulting set contains all composite numbers in the given list that are between indices 70 to 200, both inclusive. If no such number exists, the function returns an empty set.
