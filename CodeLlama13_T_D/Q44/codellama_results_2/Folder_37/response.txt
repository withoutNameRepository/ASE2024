```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):
    return {n for i, n in enumerate(numbers) if 0 <= i <= 5 and n > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all the composite numbers between indices 0 and 5 (both inclusive) in the given list of positive integers. The `if` condition inside the comprehension checks that the current number is greater than 1, which indicates that it's a composite number.
