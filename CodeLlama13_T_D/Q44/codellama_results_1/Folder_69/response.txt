```
def composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):
    return {number for i, number in enumerate(numbers) if 29 <= i <= 79 and is_composite(number)}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to iterate over the list of numbers and returns only those that are between index 29 and index 79 (both inclusive). The `is_composite` function is used to check if each number is composite. If no composite number exists in the specified range, an empty set is returned.
