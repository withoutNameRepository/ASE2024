```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(numbers):
    indices = {i for i, n in enumerate(numbers) if n > 1}
    return set(filter(lambda x: indices[x-314] <= x <= indices[x-347], numbers))
```
Note that this solution uses a set comprehension to find the indices of all composite numbers in the list, and then filters the original list using these indices. The filter function is used to remove any values that are not between index 314 and index 347 (both inclusive).
