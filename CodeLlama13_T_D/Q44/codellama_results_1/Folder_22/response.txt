```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if 50 <= i <= 200 and x > 1}
```
This code uses a set comprehension to extract all the elements from `my_list` between indices 50 to 200 (inclusive), that are composite numbers. The condition `x > 1` ensures that only composite numbers are included in the resulting set.
