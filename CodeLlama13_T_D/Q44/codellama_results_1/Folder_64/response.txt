```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if i >= 0 and i <= 4 and x > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to create the set of all composite numbers in `my_list` that are between indices 0 and 4, both inclusive. The condition `x > 1` is used to filter out the prime numbers in the list.
