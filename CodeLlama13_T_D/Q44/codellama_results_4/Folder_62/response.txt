```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(lst):
    return {num for i, num in enumerate(lst) if 30 <= i <= 87 and num > 1}
```
The function uses a set comprehension to create the set of all composite numbers between indices 30 and 87. The `enumerate` function is used to generate an index-value pair for each number in the list, and the condition \begin{code}
30 <= i <= 87
\end{code} checks if the index is within the specified range. Finally, the condition `num > 1` checks if the number is composite. If no such numbers exist, an empty set will be returned.
