```python
def composite_nums_between_indices(nums):
    return {num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if 6 <= i < 6 and not is_prime(num)}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to create a set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between indices 6 and 6 (both inclusive). The `enumerate()` function generates an iterator that returns a tuple containing the index of each number and the number itself. The `if` clause filters out any non-composite numbers, while the `not is_prime()` clause ensures that only composite numbers are included in the set.
