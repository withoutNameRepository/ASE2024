def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if 30 <= i < 31 and x > 1}
```
Note: This code uses a set comprehension to create the set of all composite numbers in the given list that are between index 30 to index 30, both inclusive. The `enumerate` function is used to get the indices of each element in the list, and the condition \begin{code}
30 <= i < 31
\end{code} checks if the index is between 30 and 31 (both inclusive). The `x > 1` condition checks that the number is composite.
