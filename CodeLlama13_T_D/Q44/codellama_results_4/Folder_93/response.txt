def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    # Use a set comprehension to create the set of all composite numbers in the list
    composites = {x for x in my_list if len(set(range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1))) > 1}
    # Return the set of all composite numbers between indices 23 and 23, both inclusive
    return composites.intersection(my_list[23:24])
```
This function uses a set comprehension to create a set of all composite numbers in the input list. It then returns the set of all composite numbers that are between indices 23 and 23, both inclusive. If no such number exists, an empty set is returned.
