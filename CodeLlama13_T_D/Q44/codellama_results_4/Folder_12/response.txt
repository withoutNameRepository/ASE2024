def composite_nums_between_indices(my_list):
    return {x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if 51 <= i <= 86 and x > 1}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to generate the set of all composite numbers between indices 51 and 86 (both inclusive). The `enumerate` function is used to get the index of each element in the list, and the condition `x > 1` checks if the number is composite.
