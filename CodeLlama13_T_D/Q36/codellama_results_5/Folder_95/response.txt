```python
def filter_chars(string):
    return "".join([c for c in string if ord("+") < ord(c) < ord("w")])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, and only includes characters that are between indices 56 and 86 (exclusive), and greater than '+' and smaller than 'w'. The `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII value of each character, which allows for efficient comparison. Finally, the resulting list of characters is joined into a string using `"".join()`.
