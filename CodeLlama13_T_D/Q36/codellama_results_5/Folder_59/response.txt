def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 107 and ord(c) > 63])
```
Note: This function uses the `ord` function to convert a character to its ASCII code, which is used to determine whether it should be removed or not. The condition `ord(c) < 107 and ord(c) > 63` checks if the character is between '?' and 'k' (inclusive). If it is, it is included in the final string; otherwise, it is removed. Finally, the resulting list of characters is joined back into a string using the `join` method.
