```
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if 323 < ord(c) < 526 and ')' < c < 'O'])
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string, keeping only those that satisfy the specified condition. The `ord` function is used to convert each character to its ASCII value for comparison.
