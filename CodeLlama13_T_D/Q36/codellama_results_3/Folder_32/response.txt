```
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 7 or ord(c) > 63])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in `s`, and keeps only those that are less than character `'7'` or greater than character `'H'`. The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of each character, which is then compared against the desired range. Finally, all the characters that meet this criteria are joined back into a string using the `''.join()` method.
