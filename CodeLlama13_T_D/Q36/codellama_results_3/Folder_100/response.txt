```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 98 or ord(c) > 114])
```
This code defines a function `filter_chars` that takes a string as an argument. It uses list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the string and check if each character is between indices 43 and 69 (exclusive). If the character is greater than 'B' and smaller than 'r', it is removed from the string. The function returns the altered string.
