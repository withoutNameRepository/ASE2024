```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 90 or ord(c) > 122])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters in the input string `s`, and checks whether each character is greater than `'H'` and smaller than `'s'`. If it is, then that character is removed from the list. Finally, the list of remaining characters is joined back into a string using `''.join()`.
