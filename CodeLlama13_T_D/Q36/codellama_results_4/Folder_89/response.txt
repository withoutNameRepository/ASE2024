```python
def filter_chars(s):
    chars = []
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if 57 <= ord(s[i]) < 69 and s[i] != '(':
            chars.append(s[i])
    return "".join(chars)
```
This code defines a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string. The function first converts the input string to a list of characters using `list(s)`. It then iterates over each character in the list and checks if the character's index is between 57 (inclusive) and 69 (exclusive). If so, the function checks whether the character is greater than '(' and smaller than 'W'. If these conditions are met, the function removes all occurrences of that character in the string using the `remove` method. Finally, the function joins the remaining characters back into a string using `"".join(chars)`.

Please note that this code uses the ASCII encoding for the characters '(' and 'W'. If you want to use different encodings or if you are working with non-ASCII characters, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
