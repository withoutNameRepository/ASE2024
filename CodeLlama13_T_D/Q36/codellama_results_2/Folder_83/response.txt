```python
def filter_chars(string):
    return "".join([char for char in string if ord(char) not in range(72, 93) or char < '<' or char > 'J'])
```
This is a simple function that takes a string as an argument and returns the same string with all characters between indices 72-93 removed. The `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII code of each character in the string, which are then compared against the range of characters specified in the question. If a character falls within this range, it is removed from the string using list comprehension. The `join()` method is used to combine the remaining characters back into a single string.
