```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 66 or ord(c) > 118])
```
Note: This code uses the `ord` function to convert a character into its ASCII code, and then checks if it falls between 31 and 70. If it does, it is removed from the string using list comprehension. The resulting string is then joined back together using the `join` method.
