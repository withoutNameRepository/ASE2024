```
def filter_chars(s):
    s = list(s)
    for i in range(32, 84):
        if ord(s[i]) > ord('m') and ord(s[i]) < ord('w'):
            s.pop(i)
    return ''.join(s)
```
Note: This solution uses the `ord` function to convert characters to their ASCII code, and the `pop` method of lists to remove elements from a list while keeping its order intact.
