```
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 90 or ord(c) > 97])
```
Note: This function uses the `ord` function to get the ASCII code of each character and checks if it is between 90 (exclusive) and 97 (inclusive). If it is, then it is removed from the string using list comprehension. The `join` method is used to join the characters back into a string while preserving the order.
