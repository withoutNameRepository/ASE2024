def if_perfect_num(list_of_positive_ints):
    return list_of_positive_ints[83] == sum(factor for factor in range(1, list_of_positive_ints[83]) if list_of_positive_ints[83] % factor == 0)
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns true if the integer at index 83 is a perfect number, otherwise it returns false. It uses the formula for a perfect number to calculate the sum of all factors of the given integer and checks whether it is equal to the given integer.
