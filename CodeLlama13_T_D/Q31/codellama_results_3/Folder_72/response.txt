```python
def if_perfect_num(mylist):
    return mylist[16] in perfect_numbers
```
This function uses the `in` operator to check whether the integer at index 16 is present in the list of perfect numbers, which is stored in the variable `perfect_numbers`. If it is present, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
