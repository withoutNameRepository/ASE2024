```python
def if_perfect_num(numbers):
    return numbers[45] == sum(factors(numbers[45]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns true if the integer at index 45 is a perfect number, otherwise it will return false. The `sum` function is used to calculate the sum of all the factors of the integer at index 45, and the `factors` function is used to generate all the factors of that integer. If the sum of the factors equals the integer itself, then it is a perfect number.
