Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'get_unique_elements' that takes two lists as arguments and returns a list of all unique elements in both lists.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution without any explanation.
```
def get_unique_elements(list1, list2):
    return list(set(list1 + list2))
