```python
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    return my_list[746] == sum(filter(lambda x: x < my_list[746] and my_list[746] % x == 0, range(1, int(my_list[746]) ** 0.5 + 1)))
```
Note that this function assumes that the list is a perfect number if the integer at index 746 is equal to the sum of all positive divisors of that integer that are less than or equal to its square root.
