```python
def if_perfect_num(numbers):
    return numbers[95] == sum(divisors(numbers[95]))
```
This function uses the `divisors` function from the `math` module to find all divisors of a number, and then checks if the sum of those divisors is equal to the original number. If it is not, then the number is not perfect. The `sum` function is used to add up all the elements in the list returned by `divisors`.

Note: This code assumes that the input argument `numbers` is a list of positive integers and has at least 95 elements.
