```
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    return my_list[478] in perfect_numbers
```
This function uses the `in` keyword to check if the integer at index 478 is in the list of perfect numbers, which is defined as follows:
```
perfect_numbers = [6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328]
```
This list contains the first six perfect numbers. The function returns `True` if the integer at index 478 is in this list, and `False` otherwise.
