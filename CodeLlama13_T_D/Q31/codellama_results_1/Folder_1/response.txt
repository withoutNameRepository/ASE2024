```python
def if_perfect_num(lst):
    return lst[85] == sum(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(1, int(sqrt(lst[85])))))**2
```
This code uses the fact that a perfect number is equal to the square of its factors. It takes a list of positive integers and checks if the integer at index 85 is a perfect number by checking if it is equal to the square of all even numbers less than or equal to its square root.
