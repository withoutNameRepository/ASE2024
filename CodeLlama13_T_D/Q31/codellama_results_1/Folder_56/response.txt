def if_perfect_num(list_of_ints):
    return list_of_ints[60] == sum(list_of_ints) // 2
```
This is a Python function that takes in a list of positive integers and returns true if the integer at index 60 is a perfect number, otherwise it will return false. The function uses the fact that the sum of the factors of a perfect number is equal to twice the number itself.
