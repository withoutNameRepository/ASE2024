```python
def if_perfect_num(numbers):
    return numbers[90] == sum(filter(lambda x: x % numbers[90] == 0, range(1, numbers[90])))
```
This function uses the `sum` function to calculate the sum of all divisors of the integer at index 90 that are less than or equal to the integer. It then checks if this sum is equal to the integer itself, which is a perfect number. If it is not, the function returns False.
