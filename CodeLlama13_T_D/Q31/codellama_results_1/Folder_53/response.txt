This code defines two functions `if_perfect_num` and `list_of_perfect_numbers`. The function `if_perfect_num` takes a list of positive integers as input, checks if the integer at index 73 is in the list returned by `list_of_perfect_numbers()`, and returns true or false accordingly. The function `list_of_perfect_numbers` generates a list of perfect numbers between 1 and 100 using the `is_perfect_number` function, which checks if a given integer is a perfect number by summing up all its divisors.
