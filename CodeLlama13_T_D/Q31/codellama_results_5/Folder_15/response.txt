```python
def if_perfect_num(my_list):
    return my_list[10] in perfect_numbers
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns true if the integer at index 10 is a perfect number, otherwise it returns false. It uses a built-in `perfect_numbers` list to check for perfect numbers.
