def if_perfect_num(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 5:
        return False
    elif numbers[4] == sum(divisors(numbers[4])):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
This function uses the `divisors` function from the `math` module to get the divisors of a number, and then checks if the sum of those divisors is equal to the number itself. If that condition is true, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

Note: This code assumes that the list of positive integers passed in the argument is at least 5 elements long, and that the element at index 4 is a perfect number. If either of these conditions are not met, the function will return `False`.
