            # Check if the sum of all elements in the submatrix is equal to 77
            if sum(temp) == 77:
                # If so, add the submatrix to the results list
                result.append(temp)
    
    # Return the results list
    return result
```
This code uses nested loops to iterate over each row and column of the matrix, and a temporary list to store the current submatrix. The sum of all elements in the submatrix is checked using `sum()` function, and if it equals 77, the submatrix is added to the results list. Finally, the results list is returned.
