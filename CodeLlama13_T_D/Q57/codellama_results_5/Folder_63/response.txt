```
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(arr):
    rows, cols = arr.shape
    for i in range(rows-2):
        for j in range(cols-2):
            submat = arr[i:i+3,j:j+3]
            if np.sum(submat) == 64:
                return submat
    return []
```
Note: The code uses the `numpy` library to handle matrices and vectors in Python.
Also, the function loops over all possible submatrices of the given matrix and checks whether their sum is equal to 64 or not. If a submatrix with required sum is found, it returns that submatrix, otherwise it returns an empty list.
