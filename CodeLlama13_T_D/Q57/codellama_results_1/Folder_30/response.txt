This code defines a function `submatrix_with_particular_sum` that takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input and returns a list of all submatrices with sum 21 in the given matrix. The function uses a recursive approach to find all possible submatrices with sum 21, starting from each cell in the matrix. The `find_submatrices` function is used to recursively search for submatrices with sum 21, and it takes four arguments: the input matrix, the row index of the current cell, the column index of the current cell, and the target sum. The base case is when the current cell is not part of any submatrix with sum 21, in which case an empty list is returned. In the recursive case, if the current cell is part of a submatrix with sum 21, it is added to the list of submatrices and returned. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned.
