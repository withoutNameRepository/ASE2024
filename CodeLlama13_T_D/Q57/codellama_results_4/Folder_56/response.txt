    matrix = matrix.tolist()
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the found submatrices
    submatrices = []
    
    # Iterate over each row in the matrix
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        # Iterate over each column in the current row
        for j in range(len(matrix[i])):
            # Initialize a temporary list to store the submatrix elements
            temp = []
            
            # Iterate over each row in the matrix from the current row to the bottom
            for k in range(i, len(matrix)):
                # Iterate over each column in the current row to the right of the current column
                for l in range(j, len(matrix[k])):
                    # Add the element at (k, l) to the temporary list
                    temp.append(matrix[k][l])
                    
                    # If the sum of all elements in the temporary list is -50, add it to the submatrices list
                    if sum(temp) == -50:
                        submatrices.append(temp.copy())
                        
    return submatrices
```
This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix of integers as input and returns a list of all submatrices with the sum equal to -50. If no such submatrix is found, an empty list is returned. The function works by iterating over each row in the matrix, then for each column in the current row, it creates a temporary list to store the submatrix elements and iterates over each row below the current row and column right of the current column to find a submatrix with the sum equal to -50. If such a submatrix is found, it is added to the `submatrices` list and returned at the end of the function.
