```
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Iterate over all possible submatrices
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0] - 1):
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1] - 1):
            # Extract the submatrix starting from (i,j) and ending at (i+2,j+2)
            submatrix = matrix[i:i+3, j:j+3]
            # Check if the sum of all elements in the submatrix is equal to 432
            if np.sum(submatrix) == 432:
                return [submatrix]
    # If no such submatrix is found, return an empty list
    return []
```
Note that this solution assumes that the input matrix is a two-dimensional numpy array of integers. It also assumes that the sum of all elements in each submatrix should be equal to 432. If you want to modify the function to check for other values, simply change the value of `432` in the code to your desired number.
