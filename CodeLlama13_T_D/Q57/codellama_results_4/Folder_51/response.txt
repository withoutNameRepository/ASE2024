```python
import numpy as np
def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    rows, cols = matrix.shape
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            for k in range(i, rows):
                for l in range(j, cols):
                    submatrix = matrix[i:k+1, j:l+1]
                    if np.sum(submatrix) == -46:
                        return [submatrix]
    return []
```
This function uses a nested for-loop to iterate over all possible submatrices of the given matrix. For each submatrix, it calculates its sum using `np.sum()` and compares it with the target value `-46`. If a matching submatrix is found, it is added to a list and returned. Otherwise, an empty list is returned indicating that no such submatrix was found.
