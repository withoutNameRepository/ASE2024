```python
import numpy as np
def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Iterate over each column of the matrix
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Initialize a temporary list to store the current submatrix
            temp = []
            
            # Iterate over each row of the submatrix
            for k in range(i, matrix.shape[0]):
                # Iterate over each column of the submatrix
                for l in range(j, matrix.shape[1]):
                    # Add the current element to the temporary list
                    temp.append(matrix[k, l])
            
            # Check if the sum of all elements in the temporary list is equal to 382
            if sum(temp) == 382:
                # If yes, add the submatrix to the result list
                result.append(np.array(temp).reshape(matrix.shape[0] - i, matrix.shape[1] - j))
    
    return result
```
Note: The above code uses NumPy's `reshape` function to convert the 1D list of elements in each submatrix into a 2D array with the same shape as the input matrix.
