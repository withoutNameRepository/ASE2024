```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    results = []
    
    # Loop through each row of the matrix
    for i in range(matrix.shape[0]):
        # Loop through each column of the matrix
        for j in range(matrix.shape[1]):
            # Initialize a submatrix with size (i, j)
            submatrix = np.zeros((i, j))
            
            # Fill the submatrix with integers from the given matrix
            for k in range(i):
                for l in range(j):
                    submatrix[k, l] = matrix[k+l, l]
            
            # Check if the sum of all integers in the submatrix is -65
            if np.sum(submatrix) == -65:
                # If it is, add the submatrix to the results list
                results.append(submatrix)
    
    # Return the results list
    return results
```
Note: The `np.zeros((i, j))` line creates a new matrix with size (i, j), where i and j are the number of rows and columns in the submatrix, respectively. The `for k in range(i)` and `for l in range(j)` loops fill this matrix with integers from the given matrix by iterating through each row and column. The `np.sum(submatrix) == -65` check checks if the sum of all integers in the submatrix is equal to -65, and the `results.append(submatrix)` line adds the submatrix to the results list if this condition is met.
