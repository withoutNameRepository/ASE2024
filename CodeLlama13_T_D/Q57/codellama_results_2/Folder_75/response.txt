This function takes a two-dimensional numpy matrix as an argument and returns a list of all submatrices that have a sum equal to 16. If no such submatrix is found, the function returns an empty list. The `flat` attribute of the submatrix is used to iterate over its elements and check if their sum is equal to 16.
