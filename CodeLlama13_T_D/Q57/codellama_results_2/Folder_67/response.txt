```
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(matrix):
    rows, cols = matrix.shape
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            for k in range(i+1, rows+1):
                for l in range(j+1, cols+1):
                    submat = matrix[i:k, j:l]
                    if np.sum(submat) == 40:
                        yield submat
```
Note that this code uses NumPy's advanced indexing feature to select the submatrix from the original matrix, and it also uses `yield` keyword to generate each submatrix lazily as they are found.
