```python
import numpy as np

def submatrix_with_particular_sum(mat):
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each submatrix of the given matrix
    for i in range(mat.shape[0] - 1):
        for j in range(mat.shape[1] - 1):
            # Check if the sum of all integers in the current submatrix is equal to 38
            if np.sum(mat[i:i+2,j:j+2]) == 38:
                # If the sum is equal to 38, add the submatrix to the result list
                result.append(mat[i:i+2,j:j+2])
    
    # Return the result list
    return result
```
Note that this solution uses `numpy` for matrix operations and iterates over each submatrix of the given matrix using nested loops. It checks if the sum of all integers in each submatrix is equal to 38, and adds the submatrix to the result list if it meets the condition. Finally, it returns the result list.
