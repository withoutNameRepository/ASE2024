```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    return {element for element in list1[90:200] if element in list2[90:200]}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to create a set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists between index 90 and index 200. The `element for` part defines the variable name for each element, and the `if element in list2[90:200]` part filters out any elements that do not appear in both lists. If no such elements exist, an empty set is returned.
