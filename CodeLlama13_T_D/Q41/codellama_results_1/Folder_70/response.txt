```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    indices = range(28, 33)
    return {element for element in set(list1[indices]) & set(list2[indices])}
```
This function uses a set intersection operation to find the elements that occur at least once in both lists between index 28 and index 32. The resulting set is then returned. If no such elements exist, an empty set is returned.
