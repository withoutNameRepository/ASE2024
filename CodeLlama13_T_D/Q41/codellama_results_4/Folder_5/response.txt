```python
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    return {element for element in set(list1[8:9+1]) & set(list2[8:9+1])}
```
Here is the same function with comments added to explain the code:
```python
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # create a set of elements from list1 between index 8 and 9 (both inclusive)
    element_set = {element for element in set(list1[8:9+1])}
    # create a set of elements from list2 between index 8 and 9 (both inclusive)
    other_element_set = {element for element in set(list2[8:9+1])}
    # return the intersection of these two sets as a set
    return element_set & other_element_set
```
