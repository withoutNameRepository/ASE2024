```python
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    return {x for x in set(list1[20:201]) & set(list2[20:201])}
```
This is a concise solution that uses sets to efficiently find the intersection of elements between two lists. The `set()` function creates a set from each list, and the `&` operator finds the intersection of these sets. Finally, the resulting set is wrapped in curly braces to create a set literal.
