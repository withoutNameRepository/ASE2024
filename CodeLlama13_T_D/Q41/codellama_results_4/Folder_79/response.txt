```python
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    if len(list1) != len(list2):
        return set()
    return {x for x in set(list1[4:8]) & set(list2[4:8])}
```
Note that this solution assumes that the input lists are of the same size and contains elements of the same type. Also, it uses sets to get the intersection of the two lists between indices 4 and 8.
