```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    return {x for x in list1[22:63] if x in list2[22:63]}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all elements that occur at least once in both lists between indices 22 and 63. The `x` variable represents each element in the first list, and the `in` operator is used to check if it is also present in the second list. If no such elements exist, an empty set is returned.
