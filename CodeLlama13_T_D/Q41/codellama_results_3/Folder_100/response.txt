```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    # find all elements that occur at least once in both lists between indexes 42 and 68 inclusive
    return set((list1[i] for i in range(42, 69) if list1[i] == list2[i]))
```
This function takes two arguments, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of the same size. It returns a set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists between indexes 42 and 68 inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, it returns an empty set.

The function first finds all elements in `list1` between indexes 42 and 68 inclusive using a list comprehension: `(list1[i] for i in range(42, 69))`. It then filters this list to only include elements that are equal to the corresponding element in `list2` at the same index using an if statement. The resulting set of matching elements is returned.
