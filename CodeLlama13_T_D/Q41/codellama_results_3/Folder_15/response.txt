```
def identical_elements(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1[2:3])
    set2 = set(list2[2:3])
    return set1 & set2
```
This is a Python code for the function called 'identical_elements' which takes two arguments, two lists of the same size, and returns the set of all elements that occur at least once in both lists anywhere between index 2 and index 2, both inclusive. If no such elements exist in the given lists, the function should return an empty set.
The solution uses sets to quickly check if there are any common elements in the two lists, and then returns the intersection of those sets. The code is delimited only by triple backticks.
