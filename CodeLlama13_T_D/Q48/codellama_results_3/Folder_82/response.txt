def return_binary_or_hexa(nums):
    a = nums[20] + 1
    b = nums[200] - 1
    result = sum(filter(lambda x: x not in nums, range(a, b+1)))
    if result % 2 == 0:
        return hex(result)
    else:
        return bin(result)[2:]
```
For example, if the input tuple is `(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)`, and `a = nums[20] + 1` is equal to 7 and `b = nums[200] - 1` is equal to 11, the function should return the binary representation string of 6 (since it is an odd number).

If all integers from a + 1 to b - 1 (both inclusive) are present in the specified range in the tuple, the function should return an empty string.
