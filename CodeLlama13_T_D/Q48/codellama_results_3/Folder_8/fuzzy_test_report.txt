Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 70, 94, 95, 98, 100, 104, 107, 112, 113, 120, 121, 122, 127, 128, 130, 131, 133, 134, 135, 137, 140, 141, 145, 146, 148, 150, 151, 152, 153, 155, 156, 157, 159, 160, 162, 163, 164, 166, 167, 169, 170, 174, 177, 180, 181, 182, 184, 187, 188, 189]

The correct answer was:
CC2

But the LLM code returned:
cc2
