Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15]

The correct answer was:
16

But the LLM code returned:
0x16

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13)
