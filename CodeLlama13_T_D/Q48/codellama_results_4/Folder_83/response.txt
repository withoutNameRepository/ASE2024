```python
def return_binary_or_hexa(nums):
    a = nums[90] + 1
    b = nums[200] - 1
    result = sum(i for i in range(a, b+1) if i not in nums)
    return hex(result)[2:] if result % 2 else bin(result)[2:]
```
This function uses the `hex()` and `bin()` functions to convert the sum to a binary or hexadecimal string representation. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove the leading `'0x'` or `'0b'` prefixes. The function also uses list comprehension to find the sum of all integers from `a+1` to `b-1` that are not present in the tuple between indices 90 and 200.
