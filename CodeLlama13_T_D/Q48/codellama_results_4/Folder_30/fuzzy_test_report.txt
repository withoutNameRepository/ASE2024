Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 35, 38, 39, 40, 42, 45, 47, 48, 51, 52, 54, 56, 61, 62, 63, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71]

The correct answer was:
110011111

But the LLM code returned:
17a
