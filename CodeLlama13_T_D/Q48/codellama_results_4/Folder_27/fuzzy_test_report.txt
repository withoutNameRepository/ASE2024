Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 136, 140, 141, 142, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 159, 165, 167, 169, 171, 172, 173, 174, 176, 180, 181, 182, 183, 186, 192, 196, 197, 198, 201, 202, 204, 206, 207, 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 218, 219, 220, 221, 222, 226, 228, 231, 232, 233, 234, 241, 243, 244, 245, 249, 251, 256, 257, 258, 259, 261, 262, 263, 265, 268, 270, 271, 272, 273, 276, 277, 279, 280, 281]

The correct answer was:
1011011011101

But the LLM code returned:
