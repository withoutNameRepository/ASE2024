Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 42, 56, 59, 62, 67, 68, 69, 70, 74, 86, 87, 90, 95, 98, 102, 103, 104, 107, 110, 112, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120, 121, 129, 130, 134, 135, 136, 137, 139, 142, 143, 144, 145, 148, 154, 157, 158, 159, 161, 163, 164, 166, 167, 169, 171, 173, 174, 180, 181, 182, 184, 185, 186, 189, 190, 191, 193, 194, 196, 199, 200, 202, 203]

The correct answer was:
D86

But the LLM code returned:
110011
