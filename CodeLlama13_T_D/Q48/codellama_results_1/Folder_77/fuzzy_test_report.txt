Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 24, 25, 28, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41, 46, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58, 62, 64, 68, 70, 72, 73, 76, 80, 81, 83, 84, 87, 90, 92, 93, 99, 100, 101, 105, 107, 108, 110, 111, 113, 115, 118, 121, 124, 126, 128, 130, 131, 133, 134, 135, 137, 138, 140, 141, 142, 151, 152, 155, 156, 157, 159, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 172, 174, 176, 178, 180, 181, 185, 188, 189, 194, 197]

The correct answer was:
ADE

But the LLM code returned:
ade
