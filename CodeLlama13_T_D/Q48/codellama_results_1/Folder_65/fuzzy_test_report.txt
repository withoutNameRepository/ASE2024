Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 57, 64, 69, 70, 79, 84, 85, 88, 90, 91, 97, 101, 103, 105, 113, 114, 116, 117, 120, 126, 129, 131, 137, 149, 150, 153, 154, 158, 160, 161, 163, 165, 166, 168, 169, 173, 174, 175, 176, 178, 180, 183, 186, 187, 188, 190, 192, 199, 202, 206, 207, 210, 212, 215, 216, 219, 220, 222, 223, 225, 226, 227, 228, 230, 233, 234, 235, 236, 240, 243, 252, 255, 256, 261, 262, 263, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278, 280, 282, 283, 285, 287, 288, 292, 293, 295, 298, 299]

The correct answer was:
1CF6

But the LLM code returned:
0x1cf6
