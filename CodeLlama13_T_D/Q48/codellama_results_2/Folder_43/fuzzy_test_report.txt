Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 17, 18, 19, 24, 27, 30, 35, 39, 41, 42, 44, 46, 47, 50, 54, 55, 56, 61, 62, 66, 68, 69, 72, 75, 79, 82, 83, 84, 86, 88, 89, 92, 96, 97, 98, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]

The correct answer was:
366

But the LLM code returned:
0x366

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19, 24, 27, 29, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 51, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 65, 69, 72, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 90, 91, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 101, 102, 103, 107, 109)
