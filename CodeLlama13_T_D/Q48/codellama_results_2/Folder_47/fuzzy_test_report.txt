Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 38, 42, 45, 47, 54, 56, 57, 58, 62, 68, 74, 78, 79, 83, 87, 90, 92, 93, 97, 99, 102, 104, 105, 106, 115, 116, 118, 121, 122, 126, 127, 128, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 137, 140, 143, 145, 147, 151, 156, 157, 159, 161, 163, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 177, 178, 183, 186, 187, 190, 192, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 202, 203, 204]

The correct answer was:
110100011101

But the LLM code returned:
CB6
