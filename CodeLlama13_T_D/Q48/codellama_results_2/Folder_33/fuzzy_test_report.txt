Out of 3 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 2 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 24, 27, 30, 33, 37, 39, 41, 46, 51, 52, 56, 58, 61, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 71, 73, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 85, 90, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 102, 103, 104, 105, 112, 113, 114, 116, 118, 122, 123, 125, 126, 128, 129, 130, 133, 134, 138, 139]

The correct answer was:
10110110001

But the LLM code returned:
10101101011

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 20, 22, 27, 30, 32, 33, 36, 38, 39, 40, 44, 45, 46, 48, 51, 54, 62, 63, 64, 68, 69, 72, 73, 74, 75, 78, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 87, 89, 90, 91, 94, 96, 97, 99, 100, 102, 104, 108, 109, 111, 116, 123, 125, 126, 127, 129, 131, 133, 135, 136)

(3) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 27, 30, 31, 38, 41, 42, 44, 45, 50, 55, 58, 61, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 73, 78, 80, 81, 85, 89, 91, 93, 94, 95, 96, 98, 100, 101, 102, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 115, 116, 118, 123, 128, 129, 132, 133)
