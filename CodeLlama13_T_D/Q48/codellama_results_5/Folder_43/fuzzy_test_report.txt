Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 19, 24, 27, 29, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 41, 42, 43, 51, 55, 56, 59, 60, 62, 65, 69, 72, 73, 75, 76, 77, 78, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 90, 91, 94, 95, 97, 98, 99, 101, 102, 103, 107, 109]

The correct answer was:
1110101101

But the LLM code returned:
1c
