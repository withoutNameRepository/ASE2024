Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 61, 65, 68, 73, 74, 83, 88, 89, 92, 94, 95, 101, 105, 107, 109, 117, 118, 120, 121, 124, 130, 133, 135, 148, 151, 153, 156, 164, 165, 168, 169, 173, 175, 176, 180, 181, 184, 185, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 195, 198, 200, 201, 202, 205, 207, 213, 214, 215, 217, 221, 225, 226, 227, 231, 232, 234, 235, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 245, 246, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 254, 255, 266, 267, 269, 271, 276, 277, 278, 279, 283, 285, 286, 287, 289, 290, 291, 293, 295, 298, 299, 301, 303, 305, 306, 308, 311, 312, 314, 315, 316, 319, 321, 325, 328, 329]
