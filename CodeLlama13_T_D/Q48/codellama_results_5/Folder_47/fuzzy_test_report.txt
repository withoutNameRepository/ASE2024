Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 35, 36, 38, 46, 47, 48, 57, 63, 64, 68, 69, 75, 78, 79, 81, 83, 87, 91, 92, 94, 95, 96, 99, 100, 101, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 118, 119, 120, 124, 126, 128, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 139, 140, 141, 142, 145, 151, 155, 156, 159, 160, 161, 163, 165, 166, 169, 170, 171, 173, 177, 178, 180, 181, 182, 187, 188, 190, 192, 193, 196, 198]

The correct answer was:
B4E

But the LLM code returned:
4f8
