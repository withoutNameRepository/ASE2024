```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odds = []
    for i in range(14, 65):
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            odds.append(my_list[i])
    return odds
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of all the odd integers between indices 14 and 64, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the indices in the specified range, checks if each integer is odd using the modulo operator `%`, and appends the odd integers to a new list called `odds`. Finally, it returns the `odds` list.
