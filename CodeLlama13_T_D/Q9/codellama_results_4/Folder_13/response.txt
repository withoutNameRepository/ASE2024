```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[25:88] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This is a list comprehension that creates a new list containing only the odd integers from index 25 to index 87, both inclusive. The `if x % 2 == 1` condition filters out any even numbers and returns only the odd integers in the range. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
