```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 30 <= x <= 200 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This code defines a function called `all_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It returns the list of all odd integers from index 30 to index 200, both inclusive, if any such odd integers exist in the input list. If no such odd integers are found, it returns an empty list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and checks each element for whether it is an odd integer between index 30 and index 200, inclusive.

Note that this code assumes that the input list is already sorted in ascending order. If the input list is not sorted, you may need to sort it before passing it to this function.
