```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 6 <= x % 2 == 1 and x <= 6]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and return only those that are odd and within the specified range. The `% 2 == 1` condition checks whether each element is odd, while the `6 <= x <= 6` condition restricts the range of values to include only integers between 6 and 6 (both inclusive). If no elements match these criteria, an empty list is returned.
