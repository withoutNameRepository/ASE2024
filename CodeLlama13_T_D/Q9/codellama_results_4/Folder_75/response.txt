```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[56:58] if i % 2 == 1] or []
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and checks whether each integer is odd using the modulo operator. If an odd integer is found, it is included in the resulting list; otherwise, an empty list is returned.
