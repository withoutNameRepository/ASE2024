def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[60:61] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd integers that are between indices 60 (inclusive) and 61 (exclusive). If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
