```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(mylist):
    return [x for x in mylist if 62 <= mylist.index(x) <= 78 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, checking each element's index and whether it is odd or not. If both conditions are met, the element is included in the resulting list. The function returns an empty list if no odd integers exist in the specified range.
