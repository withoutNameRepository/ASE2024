```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[56:83] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `lst` from index 56 to index 82, both inclusive. The resulting list is then filtered using a conditional expression to only include odd integers.
