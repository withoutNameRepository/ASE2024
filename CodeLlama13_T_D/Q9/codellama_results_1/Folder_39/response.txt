```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (20 to 30, both inclusive) and checks each element to see if it is an odd integer. If an odd integer is found, it is added to the resulting list. The `if` condition in the list comprehension ensures that only odd integers are included in the result. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
