```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 29 <= x <= 93 and x % 2 != 0]
```
Note: This code uses list comprehension to generate a new list of odd integers from the input list, using the `x` variable as a shorthand for each element of the list. The `if` clause is used to filter out elements that are not between indices 29 and 93 (inclusive), or are not odd numbers.
