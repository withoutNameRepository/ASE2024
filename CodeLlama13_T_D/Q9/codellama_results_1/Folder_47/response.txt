```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[37:76+1] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate through the specified range of indices, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers. The `+1` at the end of the slice is necessary because Python ranges are exclusive on the upper bound by default.
