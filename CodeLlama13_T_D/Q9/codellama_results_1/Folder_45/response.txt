```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 != 0 and x >= 30 and x <= 200]
```
This code defines a function called `all_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, `my_list`, which is expected to be a list of integers. The function returns a new list containing all odd integers from index 30 to index 200, both inclusive, in the order they appear in `my_list`. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Here's how it works:

1. The function first uses a list comprehension to iterate over each element `x` in `my_list`.
2. It then filters out any elements that are not odd numbers (i.e., have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2).
3. Next, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to 30 and less than or equal to 200. If so, it includes the element in the output list. Otherwise, it excludes it.
4. Finally, the function returns the resulting list of odd integers. If there are none, an empty list is returned.
