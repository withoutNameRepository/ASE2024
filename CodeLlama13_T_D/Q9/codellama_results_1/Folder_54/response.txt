def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if 34 <= i <= 55 and i % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of odd integers from the input list. The `i` variable represents each integer in the list, and the expression `34 <= i <= 55 and i % 2 != 0` checks if the current integer is both within the specified range (34-55) and an odd number. If this condition is true for any given integer, it is included in the output list. If no integers satisfy this condition, the output list will be empty.
