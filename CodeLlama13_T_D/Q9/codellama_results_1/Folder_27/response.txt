```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if 66 <= i <= 93 and i % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `my_list` and returns all odd integers between indices 66 and 93, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
