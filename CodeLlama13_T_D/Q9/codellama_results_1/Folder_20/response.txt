```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 56 <= x <= 66 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, returning only the elements that are odd integers between indices 56 and 66 (both inclusive). The `x % 2 != 0` condition checks if each element is an odd integer.
