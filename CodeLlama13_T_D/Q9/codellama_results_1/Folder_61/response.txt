```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 != 0 and 0 <= x <= 7]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and select only those that are odd integers between 0 and 7, both inclusive. The resulting list is then returned.
