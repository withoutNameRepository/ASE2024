```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 310 <= x <= 370 and x % 2 == 1]
```
Note: The list comprehension is used to create a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list that are within the specified range. The `x % 2 == 1` condition is used to filter out even numbers.
