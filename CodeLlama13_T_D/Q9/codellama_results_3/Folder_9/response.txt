def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[70:201] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range of indices specified, and checks each integer for being odd. If an odd integer is found, it is added to the resulting list. The resulting list is returned.
