def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[20:31] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and checks each element against the condition `if x % 2 == 1` to determine whether it is an odd integer. If an odd integer is found, it is included in the resulting list. If no odd integers are found within the specified range, an empty list is returned.
