```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 != 0 and 667 <= x <= 774]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list and select only the odd integers between indices 667 and 774, both inclusive. The resulting list is returned if there are any odd integers in the specified range, or an empty list is returned otherwise.
