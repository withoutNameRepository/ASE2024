```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 != 0 and 20 <= x <= 200]
```
Note: This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of only the odd integers between indices 20 and 200, both inclusive. The `x % 2 != 0` condition checks if `x` is an odd integer, and the `20 <= x <= 200` condition checks if `x` falls within the specified range. If no such integers exist in the list, the function returns an empty list.
