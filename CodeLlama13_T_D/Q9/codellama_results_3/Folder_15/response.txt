```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 1 and x <= len(my_list)]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, and returns only the elements that are odd, and have an index less than or equal to 3. The `x % 2 == 1` condition checks if the element is odd, and the `x <= len(my_list)` condition checks if the element has an index less than or equal to 3. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
