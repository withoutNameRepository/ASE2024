```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 1 and x >= 0 and x <= 9]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, and returns only those elements that are odd integers between indices 0 and 9, both inclusive. If no such elements exist, an empty list is returned.
