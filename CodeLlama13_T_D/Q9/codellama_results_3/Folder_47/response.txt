def all_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[37:76+1] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the specified range of indices, and checks each integer `x` in the list for whether it is odd. If `x` is odd, it is included in the output list. The `+1` after the end index is used to make sure that index 76 is also included in the output.
