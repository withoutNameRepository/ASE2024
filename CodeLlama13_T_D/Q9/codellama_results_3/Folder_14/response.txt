```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[5:8+1] if x % 2 == 1]
```
Please note that this function is only returning the odd integers between indexes 5 and 7, both inclusive. If you want to include all odd integers in the list, you can modify the code as follows:
```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 1]
```
