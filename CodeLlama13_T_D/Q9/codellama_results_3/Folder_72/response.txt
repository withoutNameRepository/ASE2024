```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[29:51+1] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and returns only the odd integers that exist in that range. If no odd integers are found in the range, an empty list is returned.
