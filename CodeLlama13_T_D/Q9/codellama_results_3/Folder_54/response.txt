```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[34:56] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `lst` from index 34 to index 55, both inclusive. It returns a new list containing all odd integers found in this range, or an empty list if no odd integers exist.
