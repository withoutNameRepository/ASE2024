```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[6:7] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of integers, and returns only those that are odd. The `if` clause checks whether each integer is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`) to check if it is not divisible by 2.
