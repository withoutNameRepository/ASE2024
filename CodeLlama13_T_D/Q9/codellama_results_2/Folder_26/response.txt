```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 62 <= my_list.index(x) <= 99 and x % 2 != 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over `my_list`, checks if the current element `x` is odd and if it's between indexes 62 and 99, both inclusive, using the `.index()` method to get the index of each element. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the list comprehension returns an empty list.
