```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(mylist):
    return [x for x in mylist[1:8+1] if x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive) and returns only those elements that are odd. The resulting list is then returned by the function. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
