```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[100:201] if x % 2 == 1]
```
Note: This solution uses a list comprehension to filter out only the odd integers from the specified range. The `if` clause checks whether each integer is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`) with a value of 2, which returns 1 for odd numbers and 0 for even numbers.
