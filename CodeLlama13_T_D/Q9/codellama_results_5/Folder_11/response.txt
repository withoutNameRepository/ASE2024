```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[37:52] if x % 2 == 1]
```
Note that the `range` function is not used in this solution. The list comprehension uses the slicing syntax `my_list[37:52]` to extract the subset of integers from index 37 to index 51, both inclusive. Then, the list comprehension filters the resulting list using the condition `x % 2 == 1`, which checks if each integer is odd. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
