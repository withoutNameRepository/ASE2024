def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [num for num in nums[209:557] if num % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices in the input list, and checks whether each number is odd using the modulo operator. If an odd integer is found, it is included in the output list; otherwise, it is excluded. The `if num % 2 != 0` condition ensures that only odd integers are included in the output list.
