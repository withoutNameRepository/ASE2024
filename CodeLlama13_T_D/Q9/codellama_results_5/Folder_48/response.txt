```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[533:605+1] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and selects only the odd integers. The `+1` at the end of the slice is necessary because slicing is exclusive on the upper bound, so we need to include index 605 in the range by adding one to it.
