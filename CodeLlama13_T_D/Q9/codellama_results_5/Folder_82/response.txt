```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [num for num in nums[20:201] if num % 2 == 1]
```
Here is the code with comments:
```
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    # Create a new list to store the odd integers
    odd_nums = []
    
    # Iterate through the specified range of indices
    for i in range(20, 201):
        # Check if the current number is an odd integer
        if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
            # If it is, add it to the new list
            odd_nums.append(nums[i])
    
    # Return the new list of odd integers
    return odd_nums
```
Note that the second solution uses a for loop to iterate through the specified range of indices, and checks if each number is an odd integer using the modulo operator. If it is, it adds it to a new list called `odd_nums`. The function then returns this list of all odd integers from index 20 to index 200, both inclusive.
