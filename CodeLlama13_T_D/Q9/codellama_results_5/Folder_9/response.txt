```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 70 <= x <= 200 and x % 2 == 1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `my_list` and returns all elements that are odd integers between 70 and 200, both inclusive. If no such elements exist, an empty list is returned.
