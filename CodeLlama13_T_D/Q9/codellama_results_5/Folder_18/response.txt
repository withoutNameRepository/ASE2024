```python
def all_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[35:50] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and check if each integer is odd. If an odd integer is found, it is included in the output list. The `if` clause in the list comprehension ensures that only odd integers are included in the output list. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
