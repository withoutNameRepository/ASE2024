```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the odd integers between indices 686 and 987, both inclusive. If there are no odd integers in this range, an empty list is returned. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the specified range and checks if each element is odd using the modulo operator. If an element is odd, it is appended to the `odd_ints` list. Finally, the `odd_ints` list is returned as the output of the function.
