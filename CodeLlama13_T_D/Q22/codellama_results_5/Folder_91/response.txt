```python
def find_sum_of_multiples(n):
    return sum([i for i in range(1, n+1) if i % n == 0])
```
This function defines a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` which takes one argument, a positive integer `n`, and returns the sum of the first 6 possitive multiples of `n`. The function uses list comprehension to generate a list of multiples of `n` from 1 to n+1, and then calculates the sum of the elements in this list.

For example:
```python
print(find_sum_of_multiples(3)) # Output: 21
```
This code will print `21`, which is the sum of the first 6 possitive multiples of 3, which are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.
