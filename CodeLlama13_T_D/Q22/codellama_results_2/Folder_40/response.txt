```python
def find_sum_of_multiples(n):
    return sum([i for i in range(1, 2*n+1, n)])
```
This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first two positive multiples of `n`. It uses a list comprehension to create a list of multiples of `n`, starting from 1 and ending at twice `n`, with increments of `n`. The `sum()` function is then called on this list to calculate the total.
