```python
def find_sum_of_multiples(n):
    return sum(range(1, 90 + 1) if i % n == 0 else [] for i in range(1, 90))
```
This code defines a function called `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the sum of the first 90 positive multiples of `n`. The function uses list comprehension to generate a list of multiples of `n` between 1 and 90, and then uses the built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
