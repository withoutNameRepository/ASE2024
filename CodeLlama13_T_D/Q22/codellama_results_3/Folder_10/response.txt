```python
def find_sum_of_multiples(n):
    return sum(range(1, 101) if i % n == 0 else [] for i in range(1, 101))
```
This code defines a function `find_sum_of_multiples` that takes an integer argument `n` and returns the sum of the first 100 positive multiples of `n`. The function uses a list comprehension to create a list of integers from 1 to 100, and then checks each number if it is a multiple of `n`, and adds it to the sum if it is. Finally, the sum of all the numbers in the list is returned as the result.
