def find_sum_of_multiples(n):
    return sum(range(1, 34) if x % n == 0 else range(1, 34) for x in range(1, 34))
```
The function `find_sum_of_multiples` takes one argument `n`, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the first 33 possitive multiples of `n`. The `range` function is used to generate the sequence of numbers from 1 to 33. Then, the comprehension list is created with two `if-else` conditions: if `x % n == 0`, it returns the sum of the first 33 positive multiples of `n`; otherwise, it returns the sum of all the numbers in the range from 1 to 33.

For example, if we call the function with `n=2`, it will return the sum of the first 33 positive multiples of 2, which is equal to:
```
(2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 66) = 190
```
