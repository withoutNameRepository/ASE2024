```
def find_sum_of_multiples(n):
    return sum(i for i in range(1, 6*n+1) if not i % n)
```
This is a one-line function that uses a list comprehension to generate the first 6 positive multiples of `n` and then takes the sum of those numbers using the `sum()` built-in function. The `if not i % n` clause filters out the numbers that are not multiples of `n`.
