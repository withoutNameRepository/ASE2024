def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 389 < x < 748 and x % 2 == 0]

This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the even integers from index 389 to index 748, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
