```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[43:79] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of even integers between indices 44 and 78, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in this range, it returns an empty list.
