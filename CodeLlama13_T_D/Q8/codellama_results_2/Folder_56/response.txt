```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[7:10] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a list of all even integers from indices 7 to 9 (both exclusive). If no even integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list. The list comprehension is used to filter out any odd numbers from the input list, and only return the even ones.
