def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[23:45] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even integers from index 23 to index 45, both exclusive. The `if` clause checks whether each integer is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder.
