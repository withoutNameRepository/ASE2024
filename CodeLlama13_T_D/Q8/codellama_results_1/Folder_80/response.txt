```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[69:97] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and returns only the even integers. The `if` clause ensures that only even numbers are included in the output list. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
