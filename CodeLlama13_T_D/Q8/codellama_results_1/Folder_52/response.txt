```
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[93:94] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over the slice of `my_list` from index 93 to index 94, both exclusive. It checks whether each element is even and returns a new list containing only those elements that are even. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
