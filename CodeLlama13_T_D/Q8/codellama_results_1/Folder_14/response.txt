```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[1:7] if i % 2 == 0] or []
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (1 to 7, exclusive) and checks each element to see if it is even. If an even integer is found, it is included in the output list. If no even integers exist within the specified range, an empty list is returned.
