```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 0 and 0 <= x < 4]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter the even integers from the input list, and returns an empty list if no such integers exist. The `and` operator is used to check that both conditions are met for each element in the list.
