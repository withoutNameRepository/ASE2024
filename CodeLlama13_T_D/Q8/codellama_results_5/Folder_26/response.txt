def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 44 < x < 78 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter the input `my_list` and return only the even integers between indices 44 and 78, both exclusive. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
