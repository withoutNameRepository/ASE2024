```
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 20 < x <= 93 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even integers between indices 20 (inclusive) and 93 (exclusive). If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
