```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[62:97] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all even integers from index 62 to index 96, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and check if each element is even, and returns only those elements that satisfy the condition.
