```
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 18 < x < 60 and x % 2 == 0]
```
Please note that this code assumes that the input list is already sorted. If the input list is not sorted, you may need to add an additional step to sort it before applying the above function.
