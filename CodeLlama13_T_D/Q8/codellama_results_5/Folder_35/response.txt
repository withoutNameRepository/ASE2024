```
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 10 < x <= 79 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over the elements of `my_list`, keeping only those that are even integers between 10 and 79, both exclusive. The resulting list is returned by the function.
