```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 0 and 0 < x <= 2]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list`, returning only those that are even, inclusive of index 0 to exclusive of index 2. If no such integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
