```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 0 and my_list.index(x) < 3]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of even integers from index 0 to index 2, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and filters out any elements that are not divisible by 2 or have an index greater than 2.
