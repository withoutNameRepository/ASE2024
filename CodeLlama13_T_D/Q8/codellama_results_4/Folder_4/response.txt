```
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[10:76] if x % 2 == 0]
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to create the new list of even integers. The condition `if x % 2 == 0` is used to filter out all odd integers from the input list, and only the even integers are included in the output list.
