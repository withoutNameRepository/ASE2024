```
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[30:200] if i % 2 == 0]
```
Note: The function uses a list comprehension to filter the even integers from the input list. The `if` clause checks if the current integer is divisible by 2, and if it is, it includes it in the output list.
