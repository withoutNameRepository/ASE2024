```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[80:200] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This is a simple function that takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from index 80 to index 200, both exclusive. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the original list, checking if each number is even using the modulo operator (%). If an even number is found, it is added to the output list. Finally, the function returns the resulting list.
