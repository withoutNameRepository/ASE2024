```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[73:85] if x % 2 == 0][:-1]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to extract the even integers from the specified range. The `[73:85]` syntax specifies that we want to start at index 73 and end at index 84, both exclusive. The `[x for x in my_list[73:85] if x % 2 == 0]` part of the list comprehension filters out any odd integers, keeping only even ones. Finally, the `[:-1]` at the end of the line is a slice that takes all elements except the last one, which is why we use an exclusive range in the first place (to avoid including the element at index 84).
