```python
def all_even_ints_exclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[81:87] if x % 2 == 0]
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

* The function `all_even_ints_exclusive` takes one argument, a list of integers called `my_list`, and returns the list of all even integers from index 81 to index 86, both exclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
* The code uses a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) to create a new list of all the even integers from `my_list[81:87]`. This is done by iterating over each element in that range using the `for` keyword, and filtering out any elements that are not divisible by 2 (i.e., those that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2) using the modulo operator (`%`).
* The resulting list of even integers is then returned by the function. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned instead.
