```python
def insert_at_index(lst):
    return lst[:0] + [0] + lst[0:]
```
This function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the given list, except that 0 has been inserted at index 0. This is done by using slicing to split the list into three parts: the first `lst[:0]` elements, the element 0, and the remaining `lst[0:]` elements. The resulting list consists of these three parts in order, with the new element 0 inserted between them.
