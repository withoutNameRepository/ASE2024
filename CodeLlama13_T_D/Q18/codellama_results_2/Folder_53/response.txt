This function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list of integers from index 200 to index 200, both inclusive. For each integer, it checks if it is divisible by either 17 or -5 using the modulo operator (`%`). If an integer is divisible by either of these numbers, its value is added to the result variable, which is initialized to 0. Finally, the function returns the result variable, which is the sum of all integers divisible by either 17 or -5 from index 200 to index 200, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
