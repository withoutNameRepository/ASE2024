```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    return sum(x for x in my_list[7:8] if x % 5 == 0 or x % 7 == 0)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of all integers divisible by either 5 or 7, and then sums the elements of that list. The `x for x in my_list[7:8]` part is a generator expression that produces a sequence of numbers from index 7 to index 8 (inclusive), and the `if x % 5 == 0 or x % 7 == 0` part filters out any elements that are not divisible by either 5 or 7.
