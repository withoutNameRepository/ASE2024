```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers divisible by either -90 or -67 from index 69 to index 97, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns 0. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices between 69 and 97, and checks if each integer is divisible by either -90 or -67 using the modulo operator (%). If an integer is divisible, it adds it to the result variable, which is initialized with 0. Finally, the function returns the value of the result variable.
