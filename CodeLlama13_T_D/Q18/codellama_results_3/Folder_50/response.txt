```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):
    return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(lst[46:92]) if i % 67 == 0 or i % 15 == 0)
```
This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and filters out only the integers that are divisible by either 67 or 15. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of these filtered integers. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list is a list of integers. If the list contains other types of elements, this code may not work as intended.
