```
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list[29:46] if i % 27 == 0 or i % 81 == 0)
```
This is a concise and efficient solution that uses list comprehension to generate the list of integers divisible by either 27 or 81, and then takes the sum of this list. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the total.
