```
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    start_idx = 68
    end_idx = 99
    divisors = [-37, -26]
    return sum(x for x in my_list[start_idx:end_idx+1] if x % d == 0 for d in divisors) or 0
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of integers divisible by either -37 or -26, and then uses the `sum()` function to calculate their sum. The `or 0` at the end is used as a fallback value in case no such integers exist in the specified range.
