This code defines a function called `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all integers in the list divisible by either -90 or -59 from index 51 to index 76, both inclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function will return 0.

The code uses a for loop to iterate over the indices in the specified range, and checks if each integer is divisible by either -90 or -59 using the modulo operator (%). If an integer is divisible by either of these numbers, it is added to the result variable. Finally, the function returns the value of the result variable.
