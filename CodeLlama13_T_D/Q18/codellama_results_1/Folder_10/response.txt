```
This code defines a function `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` that takes a list of integers as an argument. The function returns the sum of all integers in the list that are divisible by either -11 or -15, starting from index 32 and ending at index 99 (inclusive). If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list, and filters out elements that are not divisible by either -11 or -15. The filtered elements are then summed using the `sum` function.
