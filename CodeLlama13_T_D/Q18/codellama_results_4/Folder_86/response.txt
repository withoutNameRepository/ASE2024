```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list[54:79+1] if (x % 54 == 0) or (x % 28 == 0)])
```
This is a one-line solution that uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of integers divisible by either 54 or 28, and then uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum. The `[54:79+1]` slice specifies the range of indices to include in the calculation.
