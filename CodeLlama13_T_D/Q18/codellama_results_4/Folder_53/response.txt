```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(200, 201):
        if my_list[i] % 17 == 0 or my_list[i] % -5 == 0:
            sum += my_list[i]
    return sum
```
Please note that the solution provided is one of the many possible solutions to this problem. It uses a simple for loop and if-else statement to check if each integer in the list is divisible by either 17 or -5, and then sums up those integers that meet the criteria.
