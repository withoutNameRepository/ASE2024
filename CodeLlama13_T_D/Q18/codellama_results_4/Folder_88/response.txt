```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(arr):
    return sum([i for i in arr[3:10] if i % 6 == 0 or i % 1 == 0])
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the sum of all integers that are divisible by either 6 or 1 from index 3 to index 9 (both inclusive). If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns 0. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the filtered list, and the `[i for i in arr[3:10] if i % 6 == 0 or i % 1 == 0]` comprehension is used to filter the list to only include integers that are divisible by either 6 or 1.
