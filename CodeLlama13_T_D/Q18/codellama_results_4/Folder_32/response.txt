This code defines a function called `sum_ints_div_by_either_nums` that takes in a list of integers, and returns the sum of all integers in the list that are divisible by either 51 or 77. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices from 25 to 95 (both inclusive), and checks if the corresponding element in the list is divisible by either 51 or 77 using the modulo operator (`%`). If an element is divisible by either of these numbers, its value is added to the result. Finally, the function returns the sum of all integers that met this criteria, or 0 if no such integers exist in the specified range.
