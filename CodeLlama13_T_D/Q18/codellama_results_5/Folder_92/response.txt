```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    return sum(x for x in my_list[0:1+1] if x%2==0 or x%3==0)
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list, checking if each element is divisible by 1 or -1. If an element is divisible by either, its value is added to the sum using the `sum` function. If no such elements exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list contains only integers. If the list may contain other types of objects, additional type checks may be necessary.
