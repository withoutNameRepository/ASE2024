```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(34, 82):
        if my_list[i] % 27 == 0 or my_list[i] % 57 == 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
Note that this solution assumes that `my_list` is a list of integers. If it's not, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
