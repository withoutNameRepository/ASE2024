```
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(nums):
    return sum(n for n in nums[2:8] if n % -1 == 0 or n % -7 == 0)
```
Note that the `if` condition is a little bit tricky. It checks whether the current number `n` is divisible by either `-1` or `-7`. If it is, it will be included in the sum.
Also, note that the indexing in Python starts from 0, so we have to adjust the range of indices accordingly.
