```python
def sum_ints_div_by_either_nums(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst[32:100] if i % -11 == 0 or i % -15 == 0)
```
This is a one-line solution that uses list comprehension to generate a new list of integers divisible by either -11 or -15, and then uses the built-in `sum` function to compute the sum. The `if` clause in the list comprehension ensures that only integers from index 32 to index 99 are included in the sum. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
