    return sum([n for n in numbers[4:9] if n % 2 == 1])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of odd integers between indices 4 and 8, inclusive. The `sum` function is then called on this list to compute the total sum. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned, which evaluates to zero when passed to the `sum` function.
