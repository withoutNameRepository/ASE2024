def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum([i for i in lst[0:10] if i % 2 != 0])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of odd integers from the specified range, and then uses the `sum` function to calculate the total. The `if i % 2 != 0` clause in the list comprehension ensures that only odd numbers are included in the sum.
