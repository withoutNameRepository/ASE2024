```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst[68:87+1] if i % 2 == 1) or 0
```
This function takes a list as input and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 68 to index 86, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, it returns 0.

For example:
```python
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst)  # Output: 9
```
In this case, the function would return the sum of all odd integers from index 68 to index 86, which is 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 9.

Note that the function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and a conditional expression to check if each element is an odd integer. If an odd integer is found, it is added to the sum using the `sum()` function. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
