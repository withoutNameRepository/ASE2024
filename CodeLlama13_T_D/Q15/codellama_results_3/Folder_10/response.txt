```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: (x % 2 == 1) and (25 <= x <= 59), numbers))
```
[Instructions]
Please write a function called 'sum_odd_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.

The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
