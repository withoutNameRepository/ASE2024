```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(37,52):
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            odd_sum += my_list[i]
    return odd_sum
```
Please note that this code assumes that the list contains at least 14 elements. If there are fewer than 14 elements, you may want to modify it to handle the edge case more gracefully.
