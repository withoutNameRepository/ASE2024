    return sum(odd_nums) or 0
```
This code defines a function called `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It first uses list comprehension to create a new list of all odd numbers in the specified range (from index 19 to index 92, both inclusive). If no odd integers exist in the specified range, then `odd_nums` will be an empty list.

The function then returns the sum of the elements in `odd_nums`, or 0 if the list is empty.
