```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    result = 0
    for i in range(4, len(lst)):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 1:
            result += lst[i]
    return result
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 4 to the end of the list (both inclusive). If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. The code uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list, starting at index 4 and continuing until the end of the list. For each element in the list, if it is an odd integer, its value is added to the result using the `+=` operator. Finally, the function returns the result.
