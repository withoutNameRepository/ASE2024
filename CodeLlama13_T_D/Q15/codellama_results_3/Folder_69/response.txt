def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum([i for i in lst[32:36] if i % 2 != 0])
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 32 to index 35, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum of the odd integers, and the list comprehension `[i for i in lst[32:36] if i % 2 != 0]` is used to extract the odd integers from the input list.
