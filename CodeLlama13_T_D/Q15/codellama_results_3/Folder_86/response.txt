```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(lst) if i >= 31 and i <= 34 and x % 2 == 1)
```
This is a concise solution that uses list comprehension to filter the odd integers from index 31 to index 34, both inclusive. The `enumerate` function adds an index to each element in the list, allowing us to easily check if the index is within the specified range. The `sum` function then calculates the sum of all odd integers in the filtered list.
