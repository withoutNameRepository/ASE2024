```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(x for i, x in enumerate(my_list[60:201]) if i % 2 == 0)
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the list of integers from index 60 to index 200 (both inclusive), and only includes those elements that have an even index (i.e., indexes 60, 62, 64, ..., 198). The `sum()` function is then used to compute the sum of these odd integers. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
