```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(37, 77):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
            odd_sum += nums[i]
    return odd_sum
```
This code defines a function `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 37 to index 76, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

The function iterates over the indices in the range `[37, 76]` using a for loop. For each index `i`, it checks if the element at that index is an odd integer by using the modulo operator `%`. If the element is an odd integer, it adds it to the running sum of odd integers, which is initialized to 0.

After iterating over all indices in the range, the function returns the final sum of odd integers.
