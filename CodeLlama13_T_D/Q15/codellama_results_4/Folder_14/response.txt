```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_nums = []
    for i in range(5, 8):
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            odd_nums.append(my_list[i])
    return sum(odd_nums) or 0
```
This is a single solution to the problem, as requested. The function takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all odd integers between indices 5 and 7, both inclusive. If there are no odd integers in that range, it returns 0. The `range` function was used to iterate over the specified indices, and the `sum` function was used to calculate the total of the odd integers.
