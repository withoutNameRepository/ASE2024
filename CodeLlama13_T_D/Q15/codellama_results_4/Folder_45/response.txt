```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return sum([number for number in numbers[30:201] if number % 2 != 0])
```
Note that the function returns a list of all odd integers between index 30 and index 200, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the total sum of these odd integers.
