```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: (x % 2) == 1, nums[246:751]))
```
This function uses the `filter` built-in function to filter out all odd integers from the input list, and then returns their sum using the `sum` built-in function. The `[246:751]` slice syntax is used to extract the range of indices that include the 246th index but not the 750th index (since Python slicing is inclusive on the left and exclusive on the right).
