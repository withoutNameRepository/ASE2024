```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(22, 64):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 1:
            odd_sum += my_list[i]
    return odd_sum
```
Here is the solution to the problem. The code will work as specified and will not have any unnecessary parts or comments.
