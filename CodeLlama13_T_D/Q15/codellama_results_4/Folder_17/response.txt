def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    result = 0
    for i in range(62, 79):

    return result
```
This function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the specified range of indices (62-78, inclusive) and checks each integer in the list for oddity using the `%` operator. If an odd integer is found, its value is added to the `result` variable. Finally, the `result` variable is returned.

Note that this function assumes the input `nums` is a list of integers. If it's not, an error will be raised.
