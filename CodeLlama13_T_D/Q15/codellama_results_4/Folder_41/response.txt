```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([x for i, x in enumerate(my_list) if i >= 6 and x % 2 == 1])
```
This code defines a function `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as its only argument. The function returns the sum of all odd integers from index 6 to index 6, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

The function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list that have an index greater than or equal to 6. The `sum` function is then called on this list to calculate its sum.
