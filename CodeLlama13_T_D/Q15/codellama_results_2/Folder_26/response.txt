Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'print_unique_words' that takes one argument, a list of strings, and prints all unique words in the list without duplicates.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
```
def print_unique_words(my_list):
    print(*set(my_list))
