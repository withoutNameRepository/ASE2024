```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(int for i, int in enumerate(my_list) if i >= 310 and i <= 370 and int % 2 != 0)
```
This is a concise solution that uses list comprehension to generate a list of all odd integers between indices 310 and 370, inclusive. The `sum` function is then used to calculate the total of these odd integers. If no such integers exist, the function returns 0.
