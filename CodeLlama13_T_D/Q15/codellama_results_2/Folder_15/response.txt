```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 1:
            total += my_list[i]
    return total
```
This code defines a function called `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function uses a for loop to iterate through the list and checks each integer to see if it is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If an odd integer is found, its value is added to the total using the `+=` operator. Finally, the function returns the total or 0 if no odd integers are found in the specified range.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list)
print(result) # Output: 9
```
In this example, `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` is called with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The function iterates through the list and finds that there are two odd integers in the specified range (indexes 0 and 2). It adds these values to the total, which is returned as `9`.
