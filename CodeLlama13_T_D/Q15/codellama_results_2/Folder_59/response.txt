```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(mylist):
    return sum(mylist[i] for i in range(0, 10) if mylist[i] % 2 != 0)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to get all odd integers from the input list between indices 0 and 9, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of these odd integers. If no odd integers exist in this range, the function returns 0.
