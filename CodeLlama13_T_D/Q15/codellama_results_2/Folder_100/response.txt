```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([x for x in my_list[42:69] if x % 2 != 0]) or 0
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and uses a list comprehension to select only the odd numbers between indices 42 and 68. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the total of these odd numbers, or 0 if no such numbers exist in the range.
