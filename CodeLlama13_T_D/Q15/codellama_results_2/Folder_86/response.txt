```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(31, 35):
        if numbers[i] % 2 == 1:
            odd_sum += numbers[i]
    return odd_sum
```
This code defines a function `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as its argument. The function uses a for-loop to iterate over the specified range of indices (31 to 34, both inclusive), and checks if each integer is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If an odd integer is found, it is added to the `odd_sum` variable. Finally, the function returns the value of `odd_sum`.

Please note that this code assumes that the input list contains at least 35 elements (indices 0 to 34), and that all elements in the range are integers. If these assumptions do not hold, the code may raise an error or produce incorrect results.
