def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return sum([i for i in numbers[1:8+1] if i % 2 == 1])
```
This is a single-line function that uses a list comprehension to select the odd integers from index 1 to index 8, both inclusive. It then returns the sum of these integers using the `sum()` function. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
