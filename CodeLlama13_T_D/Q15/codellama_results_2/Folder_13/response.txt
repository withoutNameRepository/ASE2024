```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(25, 87+1):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 1:
            odd_sum += my_list[i]
    return odd_sum
```
This code defines a function called `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as its only argument. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the indices in the specified range, and checks if each integer is odd using the modulo operator (`%`). If an odd integer is found, it is added to the `odd_sum` variable, which is returned at the end of the function. If no odd integers are found within the specified range, the function returns 0.

Here is a sample input and output demonstrating how the function works:
```
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list)
12
```
