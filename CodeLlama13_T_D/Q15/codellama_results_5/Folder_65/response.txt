def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_ints = []
    for i in range(56, 99):
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            odd_ints.append(my_list[i])
    return sum(odd_ints)
```
This is a simple function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns the sum of all odd integers between indices 56 and 98, both inclusive. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the range of indices, and checks each integer in the list to see if it's odd using the modulo operator. If an odd integer is found, it is appended to a new list called `odd_ints`. Finally, the sum of the elements in `odd_ints` is returned using the built-in `sum()` function.

Note that the function assumes that the list is at least 98 elements long, and that all indices are valid. If either of these conditions are not met, the function may raise an exception or return incorrect results.
