    return sum(odd_ints) or 0
```
This code defines a function called `sum_odd_ints_inclusive` that takes a list of integers as an argument. It uses a list comprehension to extract all odd integers from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive, and then sums them using the built-in `sum` function. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, it returns 0 instead.
