```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if i >= 30 and i <= 200 and num % 2 == 1) or 0
```
This is a concise solution that uses list comprehension to iterate through the list of integers and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 30 to index 200, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
