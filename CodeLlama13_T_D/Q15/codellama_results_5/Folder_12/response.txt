```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    result = 0
    for i in range(14, 65):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
            result += nums[i]
    return result
```
Please note that this solution assumes that the input list is a Python list of integers. If you are using other data types or lists with non-integer elements, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
