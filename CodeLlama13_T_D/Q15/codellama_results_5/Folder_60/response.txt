```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum([i for i in my_list[75:86] if i % 2 == 1])
```
Explanation:

* The function takes a single argument `my_list`, which is assumed to be a list of integers.
* The function uses a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) to create a new list that contains only the odd integers from index 75 to index 85, both inclusive. This is done using the condition `i % 2 == 1`, which checks if each integer `i` is odd.
* The resulting list is then summed using the built-in `sum()` function. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the result will be 0.
