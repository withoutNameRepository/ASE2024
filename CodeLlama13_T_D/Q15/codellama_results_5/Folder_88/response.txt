def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(n for i, n in enumerate(nums) if 4 <= i <= 8 and n % 2 == 1) or 0
```
This function uses a generator expression to iterate over the list of integers `nums`, keeping only those numbers that are odd and fall within the specified range of indices. The resulting sum is then returned, or 0 if no odd integers were found in the given range.
