```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum([x for x in lst[62:63+1] if x % 2 == 1]) or 0
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 62 to index 63, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, it returns 0 instead.

Here's an example usage:
```
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst)) # prints 25 (the sum of all odd integers from index 62 to index 63)
```
