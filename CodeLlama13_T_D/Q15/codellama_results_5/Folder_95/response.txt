```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(82, 87):
        if nums[i] % 2 != 0:
            odd_sum += nums[i]
    return odd_sum
```
Here is another solution using list comprehension and a generator expression. It also uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of all odd numbers in the specified range.
```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return sum(num for i, num in enumerate(nums) if i >= 82 and i <= 86 and num % 2 != 0)
```
