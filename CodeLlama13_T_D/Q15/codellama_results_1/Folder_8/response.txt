```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(nums):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(23, 24):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 1:
            odd_sum += nums[i]
    return odd_sum
```
This solution uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list of integers from index 23 to index 23, both inclusive. For each iteration, it checks if the current integer is odd by using the modulo operator (`%`) with 2. If the integer is odd, its value is added to the `odd_sum` variable. The function returns the value of `odd_sum`.
