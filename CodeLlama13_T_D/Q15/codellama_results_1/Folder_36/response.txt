def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return sum([num for i, num in enumerate(lst[246:751]) if i % 2 == 0])
```
This is a concise solution that uses list comprehension to filter the odd integers from the specified range and then sums them up. The `enumerate()` function is used to get the indices of the elements in the list, and we use modulo division to check if the index is divisible by 2 (i.e., it's an even integer). If there are no odd integers in the specified range, the sum will be 0.
