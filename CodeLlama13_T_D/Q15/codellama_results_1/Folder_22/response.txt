```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, my_list[40:42])) or 0
```
This function uses list slicing to extract the range of indices from index 40 to index 41, both inclusive. The `filter` function is then used to filter out all even numbers and return a list of only odd integers. Finally, the sum of this list is returned or 0 if no odd integers exist in the specified range.
