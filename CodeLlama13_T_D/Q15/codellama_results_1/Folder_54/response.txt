```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(34, 56):
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            odd_sum += my_list[i]
    return odd_sum
```
Note that the `range` function includes both 34 and 55 as the start and end indices of the range, respectively. This means that it will iterate over the entire specified range, including the first and last elements.
