```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(66, 93+1):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 1:
            odd_sum += my_list[i]
    return odd_sum
```
Note that the `range` function is used to specify the indices of the list that need to be included in the sum. The `if` statement checks if each integer is odd, and if so, adds it to the sum. The `+=` operator is used to add the current odd integer to the `odd_sum` variable.
Also note that the `+1` is added to the upper bound of the range function because the `range` function includes the upper bound as an endpoint.
