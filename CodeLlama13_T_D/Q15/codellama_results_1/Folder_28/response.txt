def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return sum(i for i in my_list[62:63+1] if i % 2 == 1)
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 62 to index 63, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0. The `for` loop iterates over the specified range of indices in the list, checking each element for whether it is an odd integer using the modulo operator `%`. If an odd integer is found, it is included in the sum using the `sum()` function.
