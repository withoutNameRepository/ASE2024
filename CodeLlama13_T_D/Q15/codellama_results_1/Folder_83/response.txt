```
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return sum([num for num in numbers[90:201] if num % 2 != 0])
```
This function first creates a list of all the numbers from index 90 to index 200, both inclusive. It then uses a list comprehension to filter out any even numbers (i.e., those that have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2). Finally, it returns the sum of the remaining odd numbers in the list.

For example, if `numbers` is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]`, then the function would return `9 + 11 = 20`. If `numbers` is `[1, 3, 6, 8, 10]`, then the function would return 0 because there are no odd integers in the specified range.
