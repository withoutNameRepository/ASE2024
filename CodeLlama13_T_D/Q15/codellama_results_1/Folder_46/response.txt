```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    result = 0
    for i in range(30, 87+1):
        if my_list[i] % 2 != 0:
            result += my_list[i]
    return result
```
Note that the `range` function is used to iterate over the specified index range of the list. The `% 2` operation is used to check whether a number is odd or not, and if it is odd, it is added to the total sum using the `+=` operator.
