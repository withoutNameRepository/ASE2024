```python
def sum_odd_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    odd_sum = 0
    for i in range(4, 5):
        if my_list[i] % 2 == 1:
            odd_sum += my_list[i]
    return odd_sum
```
This is a function called 'sum_odd_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the sum of all odd integers from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. If no odd integers exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.

The code uses a for loop to iterate through the indices between 4 and 4 (inclusive) and checks if the corresponding element in the list is an odd integer using the modulo operator (%). If it is, then it adds that element to the sum. Finally, it returns the sum.
