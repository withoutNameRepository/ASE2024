```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[36:47] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate through the given list of integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from index 36 to index 46, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
