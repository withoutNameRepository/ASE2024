```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if i % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and returns only those that are even. The `if` condition ensures that only even integers are included in the resulting list. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
