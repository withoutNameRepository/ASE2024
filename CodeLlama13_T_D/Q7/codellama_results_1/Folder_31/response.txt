```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[75:89] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to filter the input list and only keep the even integers between indexes 75 and 88, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in this range, an empty list is returned.
