```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 29 <= x <= 79 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even integers from the input list that fall within the specified range. The `if` clause inside the comprehension checks whether each integer is within the range and if it's even, and the `and` operator is used to combine these conditions. If no such integers exist in the input list, an empty list will be returned.
