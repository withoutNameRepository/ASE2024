```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[80:201] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the slice of `my_list` from index 80 to index 200, both inclusive. The conditional expression `x % 2 == 0` checks whether each integer is even. If an even integer is found, it is included in the output list. Finally, the list comprehension produces a new list containing all of the even integers in the specified range.
