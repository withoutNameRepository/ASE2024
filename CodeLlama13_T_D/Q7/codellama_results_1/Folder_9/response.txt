def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[73:74] if x % 2 == 0] or []
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a list containing only the even integers from index 73 to index 73 (both inclusive). If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
