```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[59:98] if x % 2 == 0]
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of even integers from the specified range. The `if` clause in the comprehension ensures that only even integers are included in the resulting list.
