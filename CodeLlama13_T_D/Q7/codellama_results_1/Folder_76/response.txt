```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [n for n in nums[686:987+1] if n % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate the list of even integers from index 686 to index 987, both inclusive. The `if n % 2 == 0` clause is used to filter out any non-even integers. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
