```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[56:98+1] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and check if each integer is even. If an even integer is found, it is added to the resulting list, which is then returned by the function. If no even integers are found in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
