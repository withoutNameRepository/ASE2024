```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 0 and x <= 4]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of even integers from the input `my_list`. The condition `x % 2 == 0` checks if each element is divisible by 2, and the condition `x <= 4` ensures that only elements up to index 4 are included in the output. If no such elements exist, an empty list is returned.
