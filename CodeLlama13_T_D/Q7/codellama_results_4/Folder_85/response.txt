def all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[6:9] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices (6-8, both inclusive) and check whether each element is even. If an even integer is found, it is included in the output list. If no even integers exist in the range, the function returns an empty list.
