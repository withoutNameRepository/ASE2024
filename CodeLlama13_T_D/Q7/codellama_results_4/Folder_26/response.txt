def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[62:100] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. It returns the list of all even integers from index 62 to index 99, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even integers between indices 62 and 99, both inclusive. The `if x % 2 == 0` condition checks if each integer is even before it is included in the output list.
