```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[56:58] if x % 2 == 0] or []
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from index 56 to index 57, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list. The code uses a list comprehension to select all elements from the input list that are divisible by 2, and then checks if any such elements exist using the `or` operator.
