```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[26:53] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This is a concise and efficient way to solve the problem using list comprehension. The function first slices the input list from index 26 to index 53, then filters out any odd numbers by checking if their remainder after dividing by 2 is zero. Finally, it returns the resulting list of even integers.
