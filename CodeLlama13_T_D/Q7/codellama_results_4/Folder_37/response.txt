Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_even_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
