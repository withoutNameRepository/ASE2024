```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[15:40] if x % 2 == 0]
```
Here's the explanation of the code:

* `my_list`: The input list of integers.
* `[15:40]`: Slicing the list to get only the even numbers between indices 15 and 39 (both inclusive).
* `% 2 == 0`: Checking if the number is divisible by 2, which means it's an even integer.
* `[x for x in my_list[15:40] if x % 2 == 0]`: List comprehension to create a new list of all even integers between indices 15 and 39 (both inclusive).
