```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 22 <= x <= 88 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` and returns only the even integers between indices 22 and 88, both inclusive. If no such integer exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
