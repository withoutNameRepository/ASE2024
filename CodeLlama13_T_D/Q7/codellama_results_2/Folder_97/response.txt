```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(numbers):
    return [n for n in numbers[40:81] if n % 2 == 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that iterates over the slice of the input list from index 40 to index 80, both inclusive. The `if` clause filters out any odd integers and only keeps even ones in the resulting list.
