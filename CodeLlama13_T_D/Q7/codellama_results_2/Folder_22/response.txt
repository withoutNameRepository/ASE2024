```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 40 <= x <= 200 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This is a Python function that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 40 to index 200, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. The code uses a list comprehension with conditional statements to filter the input list for even numbers between the given indices.
