```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if i % 2 == 0 and 0 <= i <= len(my_list) - 1]
```
This code defines a function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers. The function returns the list of all even integers from index 0 to index 0, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over `my_list` and return only the elements that are divisible by 2 (i.e., have a remainder of 0 when divided by 2) and that fall within the specified range. The `and` operator is used to check if both conditions are met, and the `0 <= i <= len(my_list) - 1` condition checks whether the current element falls within the specified range.

For example, if `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, then the function would return `[2, 4]`. If `my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7]`, then the function would return an empty list.
