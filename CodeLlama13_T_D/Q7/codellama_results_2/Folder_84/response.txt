    return [num for num in nums[43:87] if num % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and check if each number is even. If it is, it is included in the output list. The `if` clause only includes numbers that are divisible by 2, which means they are all even numbers.
