```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[56:83] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of `my_list` from index 56 to 82, both inclusive. The `if` clause filters out any odd numbers, leaving only even integers in the result list.
