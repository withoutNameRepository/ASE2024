```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[56:67] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and checks whether each integer is even using the modulo operator. If an even integer is found, it is included in the resulting list. If no even integers are found, an empty list is returned.
