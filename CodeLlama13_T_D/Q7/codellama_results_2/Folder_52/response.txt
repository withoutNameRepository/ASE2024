```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[28:39] if x % 2 == 0] or []
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing all the even integers from index 28 to index 38, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
