```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[12:93] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list of integers from index 12 to index 92, both inclusive. It then checks each integer to see if it is even using the modulo operator and returns a new list containing only the even integers. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list will be returned.
