```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[37:52] if x % 2 == 0] or []
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and returns all even integers that exist within that range. If no even integers are found, an empty list is returned.
