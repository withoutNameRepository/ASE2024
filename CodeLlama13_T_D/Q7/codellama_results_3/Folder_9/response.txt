```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list[73:74] if i % 2 == 0]
```
This is a Python function called `all_even_ints_inclusive` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all even integers from index 73 to index 73, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.

Here's how the code works:

* The first line defines the function, with `my_list` as its argument.
* The second line uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the even integers from index 73 to index 73, both inclusive.
* The third line returns this new list if there are any even integers in the specified range, or an empty list otherwise.
