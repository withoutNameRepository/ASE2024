```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(lst):
    return [x for x in lst if 0 <= x <= 9 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `lst`, and filters out any elements that are not within the range of 0 to 9, both inclusive. It then returns the list of all even integers in the filtered list. If there are no even integers in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
