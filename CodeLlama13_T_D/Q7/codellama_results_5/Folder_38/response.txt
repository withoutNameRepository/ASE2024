```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if 22 <= x <= 63 and x % 2 == 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that filters the input list `my_list` to only include even integers between 22 and 63, both inclusive. The resulting list is returned. If no such integers exist in the input list, an empty list is returned instead.
