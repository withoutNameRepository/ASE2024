def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[56:99] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of even integers from the specified range. The `if` condition checks whether each integer is divisible by 2, and only includes it in the output list if it is. The `my_list[56:99]` syntax specifies the range of indices to include in the list comprehension.
