```python
def all_even_ints_inclusive(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[6:9] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of all even integers from index 6 to index 8, both inclusive. If no even integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The `x for x in nums[6:9]` part of the code generates a list of the elements at indices 6, 7, and 8 (inclusive), and then the `if x % 2 == 0` part filters that list to only include even numbers.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(all_even_ints_inclusive(nums)) # Output: [6, 8]
```
This code calls the `all_even_ints_inclusive` function with the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` as input. The function returns the list `[6, 8]`, which are the even numbers at indices 6 and 8 (inclusive) in the original list.
