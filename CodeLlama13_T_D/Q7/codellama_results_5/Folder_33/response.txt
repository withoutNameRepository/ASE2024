```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[667:775] if x % 2 == 0]
```
This is a solution that uses list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices and checks if each integer is even. If an even integer is found, it is added to the resulting list. The final result is returned as a new list.
