```
def all_even_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if i % 2 == 0 and 0 <= i <= 6]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of even integers from `my_list` that are within the range of indices 0 to 6, both inclusive. If no such integers exist, an empty list is returned.
