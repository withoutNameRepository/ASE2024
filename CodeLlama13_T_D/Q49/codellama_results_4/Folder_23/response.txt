```python
def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary_str):
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    decimal = int(binary_str, 2)

    # Find the 48th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence
    fibonacci_sequence = [0]
    current = 1
    while len(fibonacci_sequence) <= 48:
        fibonacci_sequence.append(current)
        current += fibonacci_sequence[-2]

    # Check if the decimal integer is divisible by the 48th number in the Fibonacci sequence
    return decimal % fibonacci_sequence[47] == 0
```
This code defines a function `if_decimal_is_divisible` that takes a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer as input. The function first converts the binary string to an integer using the `int` function and `2` as the base parameter. Then, it finds the 48th number in the Fibonacci sequence using a while loop that continues until the length of the Fibonacci sequence is greater than or equal to 48. Finally, the function checks if the decimal integer is divisible by the 48th number in the Fibonacci sequence using the modulo operator (`%`) and returns `True` or `False`.
