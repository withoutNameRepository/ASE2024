```
This function takes a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer as input. It converts the binary representation to an integer using `int` and then checks if it is divisible by the 134th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence (which is the 13th element of the list). The function returns True if the number is divisible, and False otherwise.
