def if_decimal_is_divisible(binary):

    num = int(binary, 2)
    
    # Find the 138th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence
    fib138 = fib(137) + fib(136)

```
This function takes a binary representation string of a non-negative decimal integer as input, and returns `True` if the decimal integer corresponding to that string is divisible by the 138th number that occurs in the Fibonacci sequence, and `False` otherwise. The function uses the `fib()` function to calculate the 138th Fibonacci number.
