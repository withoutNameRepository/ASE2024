def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[17:79]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest element from index 17 to index 78, both inclusive. It first sorts the list using the built-in `sorted()` function, then it slices the list from index 17 to index 78 and returns the resulting list.
