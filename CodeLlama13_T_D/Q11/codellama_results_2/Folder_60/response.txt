```python
def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[75:86][-1]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input, sorts the list, slices it to get the elements from index 75 to index 85 (both inclusive), and returns the last element of that slice which will be the largest element in that range.
