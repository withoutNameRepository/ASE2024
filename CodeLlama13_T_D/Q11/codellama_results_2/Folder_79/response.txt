```python
def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[3:4]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest element from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and then `[3:4]` is used to return the element at index 4 (both inclusive).

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the output would be `5`.
