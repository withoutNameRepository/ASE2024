```
def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[15:40]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest element from index 15 to index 39, both inclusive. It does this by first sorting the list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, then slicing the resulting list to return the elements from indices 15 to 39.
