def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return max([my_list[i] for i in range(0, 5)])
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest element from index 0 to index 4, both inclusive. The `max` function is used to find the largest number in the list, and the `[my_list[i] for i in range(0, 5)]` part creates a new list with only the elements from index 0 to index 4, both inclusive.
