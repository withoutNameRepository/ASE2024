def find_largest_num(nums):
    return sorted(nums)[27:56][-1]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest element from index 27 to index 55, both inclusive. The solution uses the `sorted()` function to sort the list, then slices the list from indices 27 to 55 using square brackets notation `[ ]`, and finally accesses the last element of the slice using negative indexing `-1`.
