def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[25:60][-1]
```
This function first sorts the list of numbers using the `sorted()` function, then slices the list from index 25 to index 59 (inclusive) using square brackets, and finally returns the last element of that slice, which is the largest element in that range.
