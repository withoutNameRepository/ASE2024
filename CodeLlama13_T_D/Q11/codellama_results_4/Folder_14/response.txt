```
def find_largest_num(nums):
    return sorted(nums)[5:8]
```
This function first sorts the input list using the built-in `sorted()` function, then it returns a slice of the list from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive. The `[5:8]` syntax means "return all elements from index 5 up to but not including index 8".
