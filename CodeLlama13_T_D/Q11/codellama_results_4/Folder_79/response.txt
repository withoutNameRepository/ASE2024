```python
def find_largest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[3:4]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest element from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. It first sorts the list using the `sorted()` function, then it slices the list to get the fourth element (index 3) and returns it.
