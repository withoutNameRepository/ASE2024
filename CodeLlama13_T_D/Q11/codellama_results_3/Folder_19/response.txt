```
def find_largest_num(nums):
    return sorted(nums)[3:6]
```
This is a simple function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the largest element from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the built-in `sorted()` function and then returns the slice of the sorted list from indices 3 to 6 (both inclusive).

Here's an example usage of this function:
```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
largest_num = find_largest_num(nums)
print(largest_num)  # Output: [6, 7, 8]
```
Note that this function assumes the input list is not empty and that there are at least 6 elements in the list. If these assumptions do not hold, you may need to add additional error handling or validation checks to the function.
