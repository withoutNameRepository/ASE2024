```python
def find_largest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[10:67]
```
Note that the function `sorted()` sorts a list of numbers and returns a new list with the elements in ascending order. The slice notation `[10:67]` selects the 56th to 72nd element from the sorted list, which is the largest element from index 10 to index 66, both inclusive.
