```python
def find_largest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[4:5]
```
This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns the largest element from index 4 to index 4, both inclusive. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and then the slice notation `[4:5]` is used to extract the element at index 4.

Here's an example of how this function can be used:
```python
>>> find_largest_num([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
[4]
>>> find_largest_num([10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60])
[40]
```
