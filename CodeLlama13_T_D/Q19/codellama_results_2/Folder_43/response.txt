def all_ints_not_div_by_num(arr):
    return [x for x in arr[16:87] if x % -15 != 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers from index 16 to index 87 that are not divisible by -15. The `x % -15` expression returns 0 if `x` is divisible by -15, and non-zero otherwise.
