```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[43:70] if x % 69 != 0]
```
Note that this function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers from the input `my_list` that are not divisible by 69. The `if x % 69 != 0` clause filters out any integers that are divisible by 69, and the `[43:70]` slice specifies the range of indices to consider in the list. If no such integers exist in this range, the function returns an empty list.
