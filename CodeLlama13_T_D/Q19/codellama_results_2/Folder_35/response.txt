```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[15:57] if x % 86 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of indices, and returns only those integers that are not divisible by 86. If no such integers exist in the range, an empty list is returned.
