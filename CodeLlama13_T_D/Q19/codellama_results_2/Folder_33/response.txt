```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[103:574] if x % -514 != 0]
```
Explanation:

* `my_list` is the input list of integers.
* `x for x in my_list[103:574]` loops over all the elements in the specified range.
* `if x % -514 != 0` checks if each element is not divisible by `-514`. If it's not, it's included in the output list.
* The output list is returned by the function.

Note that this solution uses a [list comprehension](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) to create the output list, which is a concise and efficient way to generate a new list from an existing one based on certain conditions.
