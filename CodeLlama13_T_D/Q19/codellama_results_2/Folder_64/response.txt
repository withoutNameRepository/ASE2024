def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [i for i in my_list if i % 2 != 0 and 2 <= i < len(my_list)]
```
This is a list comprehension that returns all integers from `my_list` that are not divisible by 2, and are within the specified range of indices. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if each integer is divisible by 2, and the `and` keyword to check that the integer is within the specified range of indices.

Here's an example usage:
```
my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list)) # prints [3, 5, 7, 9]
```
