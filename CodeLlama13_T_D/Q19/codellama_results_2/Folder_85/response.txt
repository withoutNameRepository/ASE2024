```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[3:9] if x % 6 != 0]
```
You can test the function with this code:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list)) # Output: [4, 5, 7, 8]
```
You can also test the function with an empty list as input:
```python
my_list = []
print(all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list)) # Output: []
```
