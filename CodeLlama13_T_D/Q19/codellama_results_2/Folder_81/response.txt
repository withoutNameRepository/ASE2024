```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[10:100] if x % 100 != 0]
```
This function takes a list as input, and returns the list of integers from index 10 to index 100 (exclusive) that are not divisible by 100. If no such integers exist in the specified range, it returns an empty list.
