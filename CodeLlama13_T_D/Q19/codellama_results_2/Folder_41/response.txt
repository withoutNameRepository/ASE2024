def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % -3 != 0 and 0 <= x < 8]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are not divisible by `-3` and are within the specified range of `0` to `8`, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
