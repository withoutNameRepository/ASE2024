```
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[22:97] if x % -46 != 0]
```
This code uses list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are not divisible by -46 from index 22 to index 97, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
