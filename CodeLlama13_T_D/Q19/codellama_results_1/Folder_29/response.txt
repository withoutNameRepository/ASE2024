```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(nums):
    return [x for x in nums[24:26] if x % -30 != 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns the list of all integers from indices 24 to 25, both exclusive, that are not divisible by `-30`. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
