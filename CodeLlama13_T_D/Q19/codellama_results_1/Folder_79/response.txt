```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(8, 10):
        if my_list[i] % -3 != 0:
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
Please note that this function assumes that the list is not empty and has at least 10 elements from index 8 to index 9, both exclusive. If any of these conditions are not met, the function will raise an error or return an incorrect result.
