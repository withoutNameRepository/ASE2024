```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[70:98] if x % -88 != 0]
```
Note: This function uses list comprehension to create a new list of integers from the specified range that are not divisible by -88. The `if` clause is used to filter out the elements that are divisible by -88, and the `return` statement returns an empty list if no such elements exist in the specified range.
