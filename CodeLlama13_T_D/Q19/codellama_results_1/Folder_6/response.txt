```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[43:70] if x % 69 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers from the specified range that are not divisible by 69. The `if` clause in the list comprehension checks whether each integer is divisible by 69, and if it is not, it adds it to the output list. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
