def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[20:51] if x % -48 != 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that returns the list of integers from indices 20 to 51, both exclusive, that are not divisible by -48. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
