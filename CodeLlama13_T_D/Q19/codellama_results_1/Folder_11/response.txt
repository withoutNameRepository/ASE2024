```
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(36, 85):
        if my_list[i] % -27 != 0:
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
Note that the `-27` divisor is negative, so it needs to be handled carefully when checking for modulo equality. The `range()` function starts at index 36 and ends at index 84, both exclusive, which means the last element in the range will be index 84, not 85.
