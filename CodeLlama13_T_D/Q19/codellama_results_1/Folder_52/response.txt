```
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    result = []
    for i in range(50, 93):
        if my_list[i] % 16 != 0:
            result.append(my_list[i])
    return result
```
Please note that this code assumes the list has at least 50 elements and that all elements are integers. If you need to handle different types of inputs or if you want to add additional checks, please let me know and I'll be happy to help you further.
