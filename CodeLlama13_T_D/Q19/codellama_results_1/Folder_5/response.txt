```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[1:2] if x % 8 != 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that returns the list of integers from `my_list[1:2]` (the range between indexes 1 and 2, exclusive) that are not divisible by 8. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
