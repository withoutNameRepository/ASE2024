```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[43:77] if x % 84 != 0]
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and checks whether each integer is divisible by 84. If an integer is not divisible by 84, it is included in the output list. The `if` clause ensures that only integers not divisible by 84 are included in the output list.
