This code defines a function called `all_ints_not_div_by_num` that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by -1 from index 0 to index 1, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list and checks if each integer is not divisible by -1 using the modulo operator. If it is not divisible, the integer is appended to the result list. Finally, the result list is returned.

Please note that this code assumes that the input list contains only integers. If you want to handle other data types as well, you can modify the function accordingly.
