    return [x for x in my_list if (x % 5) != 0 and 1 < x < 2]
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list containing only the integers from the original list that are not divisible by 5. The `and` operator is used to ensure that the integer is also between index 1 (inclusive) and index 2 (exclusive). If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
