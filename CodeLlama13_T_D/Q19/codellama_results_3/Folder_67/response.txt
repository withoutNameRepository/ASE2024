```
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[48:92] if x % 90 != 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of integers from index 48 to index 92, both exclusive, that are not divisible by 90. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.

Here's an example usage:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list)) # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
```
