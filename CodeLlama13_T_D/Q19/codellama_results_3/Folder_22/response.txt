```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[40:201] if x % 71 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and checks whether each integer is divisible by 71. If an integer is not divisible by 71, it is included in the output list. The function returns an empty list if no integers in the specified range are not divisible by 71.
