This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns a new list containing all the integers that are not divisible by 1 from index 0 to index 1, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned. The `range()` function is used to iterate over the list, and the `%` operator is used to check if each number is divisible by 1.
