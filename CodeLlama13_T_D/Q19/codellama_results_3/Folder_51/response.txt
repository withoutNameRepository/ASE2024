```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[1:6] if x % 2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the specified range of the input list, and checks whether each element is divisible by 2. If an element is not divisible by 2, it is included in the output list. The `if` clause ensures that only integers not divisible by 2 are included in the output list.
