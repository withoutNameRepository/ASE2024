```
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % -2 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input `my_list`, and returns a new list containing only those elements that are not divisible by `-2`. The `%` operator is used to check whether an element is divisible by `-2`, and the condition `x % -2 != 0` specifies that only those elements with a remainder of 1 when divided by `-2` should be included in the output.
