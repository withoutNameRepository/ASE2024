def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % 10 != 0 and 0 <= x < 10]
```
This code uses list comprehension to create a new list with the integers not divisible by 10 from index 0 to index 9, both exclusive. The `x % 10 != 0` condition ensures that only integers not divisible by 10 are included in the output list. Additionally, the `0 <= x < 10` condition ensures that only integers between indices 0 and 9 (exclusive) are considered. If no such integers exist in the input list, an empty list is returned.
