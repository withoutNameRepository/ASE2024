```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[43:91] if x % -68 != 0]
```
This is a list comprehension that returns the list of integers from index 43 to index 90 (exclusive) that are not divisible by -68. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
