def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[38:52] if x % -41 != 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a new list that contains all the integers from index 38 to index 52 (exclusive) that are not divisible by -41. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
