```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list if x % -2 != 0 and 0 <= x < 3]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input, and returns the list of all integers not divisible by `-2` from index `0` to index `2`, both exclusive. If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list. The list comprehension `[x for x in my_list if x % -2 != 0 and 0 <= x < 3]` filters out all elements that are not divisible by `-2` and returns only those elements that satisfy this condition.
