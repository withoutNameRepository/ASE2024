```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[45:72] if x % 93 != 0]
```
This code uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers from the specified range that are not divisible by 93. The `if` clause checks each integer in the range and only includes it in the output list if its remainder when divided by 93 is not equal to zero (i.e., it is not divisible by 93). If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
