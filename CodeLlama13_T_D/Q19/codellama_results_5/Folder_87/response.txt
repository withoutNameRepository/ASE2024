```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):
    return [x for x in lst[19:69] if x % 97 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a new list of integers that are not divisible by 97 from the specified range. The `if` clause checks whether each integer is divisible by 97, and only includes those that are not in the resulting list.
