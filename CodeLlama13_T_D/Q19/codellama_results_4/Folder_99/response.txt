def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[387:516] if x % 310 != 0]
```
Explanation:

* We use list comprehension to create a new list containing only the elements that are not divisible by 310.
* The condition `x % 310 != 0` checks whether an element is not divisible by 310, and we include it in the list if this condition is true.
* We use slicing to extract the relevant part of the list, from index 387 (inclusive) to index 516 (exclusive).
* If no such integers exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.
