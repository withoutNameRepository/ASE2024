```python
def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[59:93] if x % -26 != 0]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a list containing all integers from indices 59 to 93, both exclusive, that are not divisible by -26. If no such integer exists in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
