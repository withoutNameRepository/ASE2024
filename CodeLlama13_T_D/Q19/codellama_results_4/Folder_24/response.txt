def all_ints_not_div_by_num(my_list):
    return [x for x in my_list[40:70] if x % -82 != 0]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the list `my_list` from indices 40 to 69 (exclusive) and returns a new list containing only those elements that are not divisible by -82. If no such integers exist in the specified range, an empty list is returned.
