def all_ints_not_div_by_num(lst):
    return [i for i in lst if i % 13 != 0 and 0 <= i < 6]
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of integers that are not divisible by 13 from the input list. The `if` clause checks that each integer is not divisible by 13, and the second clause ensures that only the first six elements of the list are included in the result.
