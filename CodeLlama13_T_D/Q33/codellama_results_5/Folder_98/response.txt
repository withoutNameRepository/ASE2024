```python
def return_vowels(string):
    vowels = []
    for i in range(3, 9):
        if string[i].lower() in "aeiou" and string[i] > "s":
            vowels.append(string[i])
    return vowels
```
This code defines a function called `return_vowels` that takes one argument, a string. The function returns a list of all vowel English letters between index 3 (inclusive) and index 9 (exclusive) that are greater than character S and smaller than or equal to character U. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function returns an empty list.

The function first initializes a list called `vowels` to store the vowel letters found in the string. Then it iterates over each character in the string using a for loop with the range of 3 to 9 (exclusive). For each character, it checks if it is a vowel letter and whether it is greater than character S. If both conditions are met, the function appends the current character to the `vowels` list. Finally, the function returns the `vowels` list as the result of the function call.
