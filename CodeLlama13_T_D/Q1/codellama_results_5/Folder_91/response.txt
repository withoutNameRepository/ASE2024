```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[:6]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of elements from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. It does this by using slicing notation `[start:stop:step]` with `start=0`, `stop=6` (one beyond the last element), and `step=1`. The function name `all_ints_inclusive` is a bit misleading because it returns all elements from index 0 to index 5, not just the integers. However, this solution does meet the requirement of returning all elements from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive.
