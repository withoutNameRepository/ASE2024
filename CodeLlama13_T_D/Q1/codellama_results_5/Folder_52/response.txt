```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[62:79]
```
This is a simple function that takes a list of integers as an argument and returns a new list containing all the elements from index 62 to index 78, both inclusive. The `:` syntax used in the return statement specifies the start and end indices of the slice, and the `[]` brackets around it specify that we want to return a new list with those elements.

Here's an example usage:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(all_ints_inclusive(my_list)) # prints [7, 8, 9]
```
