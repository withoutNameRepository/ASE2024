```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[30:49]
```
Note that this function uses slice notation to extract the elements from index 30 to index 48, both inclusive. The syntax `my_list[start:end]` returns all elements of the list from `start` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive). By setting `end=49`, we ensure that the last element is included in the output.
