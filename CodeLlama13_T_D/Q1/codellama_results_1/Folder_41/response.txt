```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[0:3]
```
This is a function definition that creates a function called `all_ints_inclusive`. It takes one argument, `my_list`, which is a list of integers. The function returns the list of all elements from index 0 to index 2, both inclusive. This is done by using slicing syntax in Python, where `[0:3]` means "return all elements from index 0 to index 2, both inclusive".
