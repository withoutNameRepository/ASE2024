```
def all_ints_inclusive(mylist):
    return mylist[54:99]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the elements from index 55 to index 98, both inclusive. It uses slicing syntax to extract the desired elements from the list. The slice `[54:99]` includes element 55, so it is necessary to subtract one from the starting index in order to get the correct output.
