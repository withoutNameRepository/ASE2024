```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[262:747]
```
Note that the function takes a list of integers as an argument, and returns a new list with elements from index 262 to index 746, both inclusive. The `:` notation in Python indicates slicing, which allows you to extract a portion of a list.
