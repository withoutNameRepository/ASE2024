```
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[40:201]
```
This function takes in a list of integers and returns the list of elements from index 40 to index 200, both inclusive. The syntax is `list[start:stop]`, where start and stop are indices that can be specified as positive or negative numbers. In this case, we specify `my_list[40:201]` which means the elements from index 40 to index 200, both inclusive.
