```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[3:4]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns a sublist that contains all elements from index 3 to index 3, both inclusive. The `[3:4]` syntax specifies that the sublist should start at the third element (index 2) and end at the fourth element (index 3).

Here is an example of how you can use this function:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(all_ints_inclusive(my_list)) # Output: [3, 4]
```
