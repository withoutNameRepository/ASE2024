```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[2:3+1]
```
Note that the syntax `my_list[start:end+1]` means "return a slice of the list from index `start` to index `end`, both inclusive." In this case, `start=2` and `end=3`, so the function returns all elements from index 2 to index 3, both inclusive.
