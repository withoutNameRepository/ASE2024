```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[1:6]
```
This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the list of elements from index 1 to index 5, both inclusive. It uses slicing syntax `my_list[start:stop]` where `start` is the start index (inclusive) and `stop` is the end index (exclusive). Since we want to include index 5, we set `stop` to 6 instead of 5.

For example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
all_ints_inclusive(my_list)
# Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
