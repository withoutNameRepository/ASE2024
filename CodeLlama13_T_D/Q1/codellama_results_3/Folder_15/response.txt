```
Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification. <Write a function called 'all_ints_inclusive' that takes one argument, a list of integers, and returns the list of all elements from index 3 to index 3, both inclusive.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
```python
def all_ints_inclusive(my_list):
    return my_list[3:4]
```
