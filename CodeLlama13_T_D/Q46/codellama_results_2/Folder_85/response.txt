def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return _greatest_common_divisor(numbers[49], numbers[46], numbers[13])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 49, 46, and 13. It does this by calling the `_greatest_common_divisor` function with the three numbers as arguments.
