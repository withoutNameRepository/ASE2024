```
def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return __
```
This solution uses a list comprehension to find the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 341, 238 and 374:
```
def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return max([__ for _ in numbers if _ in [341, 238, 374]])
```
Note that this solution assumes that the list of positive integers is provided as a list. If the input is a string or any other type, you may need to convert it to a list first.
