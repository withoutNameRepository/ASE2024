```
def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    return __gcd(my_list[78], __gcd(my_list[19], my_list[13]))
```
This code defines a function `gcf_three_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as its argument. The function uses the `__gcd` method to compute the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 78, 19 and 13. It then returns this GCF value.

Note: In Python, the `__gcd` method is used to compute the greatest common divisor of two or more integers.
