def gcf_three_nums(num_list):

To find the greatest common factor of three numbers, you can use the `math.gcd` function from the Python standard library. The `gcd` function takes two arguments, so we'll have to call it twice to find the gcf of all three numbers.

First, we'll extract the three numbers from the list using indexing. Then, we'll call `gcd` on the first two numbers and assign the result to a variable. Next, we'll call `gcd` again with the previous result as the first argument and the third number as the second argument. The final result will be the gcf of all three numbers.
```
from math import gcd

def gcf_three_nums(num_list):
    num1 = num_list[21]
    num2 = num_list[51]
    num3 = num_list[33]
    return gcd(gcd(num1, num2), num3)
```
