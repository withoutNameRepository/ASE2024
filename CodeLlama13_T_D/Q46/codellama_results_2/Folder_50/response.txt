```python
def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return _find_gcf(numbers[20], numbers[35], numbers[74])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as its argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 20, 35, and 74. It does this by calling the `_find_gcf` function with the three relevant numbers as arguments.
