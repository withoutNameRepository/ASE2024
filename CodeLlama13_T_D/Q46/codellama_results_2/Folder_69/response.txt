<Instruction for the student>

The `______________` should be replaced by a Python expression that returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 404, 834 and 517 in the list `numbers`.

You can use the built-in function `gcd()` from the `math` module to find the greatest common divisor of two or more numbers.
