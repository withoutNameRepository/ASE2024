def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return __gcd(numbers[13], __gcd(numbers[76], numbers[44]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as its argument and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 13, 76, and 44. It does this by using the `__gcd` built-in function to calculate the greatest common divisor of the three numbers at these indices, which is then returned.

Note: The `__gcd` function is a helper function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two or more integers. It is not intended for external use and has been renamed with an underscore to indicate this.
