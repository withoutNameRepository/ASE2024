def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return _______________
```
This is a function that takes in a list of positive integers and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 20, 43, and 95. It uses the `gcd` function from the Python standard library to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and then calculates the GCD of that with the number at index 95.

To use this function, you can call it with a list of positive integers as an argument, like this:
```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
gcf_three_nums(numbers)
```
This will return the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 20, 43, and 95 in the list `numbers`.
