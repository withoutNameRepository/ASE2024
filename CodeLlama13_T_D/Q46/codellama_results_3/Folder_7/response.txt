```
This function uses the `gcd` function from the `fractions` module to calculate the greatest common factor of three numbers. The `gcd` function takes two arguments, and returns their greatest common divisor. By calling it with each pair of numbers in turn, we can compute the greatest common factor of all three numbers.
