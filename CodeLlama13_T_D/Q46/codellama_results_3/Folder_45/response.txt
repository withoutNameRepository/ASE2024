```
def gcf_three_nums(num_list):
    return __gcd(num_list[46], __gcd(num_list[84], num_list[23]))
```
This code defines a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes one argument, a list of positive integers, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 46, 84, and 23. The function uses the built-in `__gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is then used to calculate the greatest common divisor of three numbers by recursively calling itself with the first two numbers as arguments and the third number as the next argument.

For example, if `num_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]`, then `gcf_three_nums(num_list)` would return `10`.
