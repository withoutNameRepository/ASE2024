```python
def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    return __gcf__(my_list[90], my_list[84], my_list[47])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input, and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 90, 84, and 47. It does this by calling another function called `__gcf__`, which is defined elsewhere in the code. The `__gcf__` function is not included here because it is not part of the solution to the problem you described.
