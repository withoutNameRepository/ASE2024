```python
def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return nums[8]*nums[9]//gcd(nums[8], nums[9])*nums[3]//gcd(nums[3], nums[8])
```
This code defines a function called `gcf_three_nums` that takes a list of positive integers as its argument. The function returns the greatest common factor (GCF) of the elements at indices 8, 9 and 3.

The function first computes the product of the two elements at indices 8 and 9 using the `*` operator. Then it uses the `//` operator to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two elements. Finally, it multiplies the result by the element at index 3 and divides the result by the GCD of this product and index 3 using the `*//` operators.

Note that the `gcd` function is a built-in function in Python that computes the GCD of two numbers.
