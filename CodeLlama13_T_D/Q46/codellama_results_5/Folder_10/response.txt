```python
def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return _gcf(numbers[86], numbers[89], numbers[49])

def _gcf(a, b, c):
    while True:
        if a % b == 0 and b % c == 0:
            return b
        elif b % a == 0 and a % c == 0:
            return a
        elif c % a == 0 and a % b == 0:
            return a
        else:
            a, b = max(a, b), min(a, b)
```
Note: The `_gcf` function is an implementation of the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. It is used in the `gcf_three_nums` function to find the GCD of three numbers.
