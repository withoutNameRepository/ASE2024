```python
def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return gcd(numbers[20], gcd(numbers[17], numbers[28]))
```
The `gcd` function is the greatest common divisor of two integers, which is defined as the largest integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. The function can be implemented using the Euclidean algorithm or other methods.
