def gcf_three_nums(my_list):

```
You can use the `gcd()` function from Python's `math` module to calculate the greatest common factor of two numbers. You can also use a loop to find the greatest common factor of three or more numbers. Here is an example implementation:
```
from math import gcd

def gcf_three_nums(my_list):
    return gcd(gcd(my_list[13], my_list[70]), my_list[32])
```
