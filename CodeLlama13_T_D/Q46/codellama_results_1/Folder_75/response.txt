```python
def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return __
```
The function `gcf_three_nums` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor (gcf) of the elements at indices 70, 98, and 22. To calculate the gcf, you can use the `math.gcd` function from the Python standard library, which calculates the greatest common divisor of two or more numbers.

Here's an example implementation:
```python
from math import gcd

def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return gcd(numbers[70], gcd(numbers[98], numbers[22]))
```
This function first calculates the gcd of `numbers[70]` and `numbers[98]`, then it uses this result as the second argument for the `gcd` function to calculate the final gcf.
