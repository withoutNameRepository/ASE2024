def gcf_three_nums(nums):
    return gcd(nums[85], gcd(nums[36], nums[54]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers `nums` as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 85, 36 and 54. It does this by first calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `nums[85]` and `nums[36]`, then using that value to calculate the GCD of `nums[36]` and `nums[54]`. Finally, it returns the final result.

For example, if we pass in a list `nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]` as input, the function would return `10`, since it is the greatest common factor of `nums[85] = 90` and `nums[36] = 70`. Similarly, if we pass in a list `nums = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99]` as input, the function would return `1`, since it is the greatest common factor of `nums[85] = 99` and `nums[36] = 77`.
