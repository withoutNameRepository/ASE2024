I have generated this answer based on the text specification you provided. The function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor of the elements at indices 558, 110, and 628 in the list.

Note that this solution assumes that the indices are valid and that the list contains enough elements to access the specified indices without causing an index error. If you need a more robust solution that can handle invalid indices or lists with fewer elements, please let me know and I can provide a different answer.
