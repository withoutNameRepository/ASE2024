def gcf_three_nums(numbers):
    return ___
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the greatest common factor (gcf) of the elements at indices 341, 238, and 374. The gcf is computed using the following formula:

gcf(a, b, c) = gcd(a, b, c)

where gcd stands for greatest common divisor.

The function uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the gcd of three numbers. The `gcd` function takes two arguments and returns their gcd. To compute the gcf of multiple numbers, we can use the recursive definition of the gcd as follows:

gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)

where `%` is the modulo operator. This formula says that the gcd of `a` and `b` is equal to the gcd of `b` and the remainder of dividing `a` by `b`. By recursively applying this formula with `a = numbers[341]`, `b = numbers[238]`, and `c = numbers[374]`, we can compute the gcf of these three numbers.

The function returns the result of computing the gcf using the above formula.
