This function uses a simple algorithm to find all left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers less than or equal to `x`. It starts by iterating over all positive integers from 2 to `x` using a for loop. For each integer `i`, it checks if it is a prime number and does not contain any zeroes using the `is_prime()` and `contains_zero()` functions, respectively. If both conditions are met, `i` is added to the list of left-and-right-truncatable prime numbers, which is eventually returned sorted in ascending order.
