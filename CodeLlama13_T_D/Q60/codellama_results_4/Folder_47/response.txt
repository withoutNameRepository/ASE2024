```
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and not contains_0(str(i)):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes)
```
Note: The `is_prime` function and the `contains_0` function are not included in this solution, but they can be easily defined based on the requirements of the problem.
