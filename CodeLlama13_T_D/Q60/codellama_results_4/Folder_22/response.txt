```python
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    left_trunc = []
    right_trunc = []
    for num in nums:
        if str(num)[1:-1]:
            continue
        if is_prime(num) and is_prime(num[:-1]) and is_prime(num[1:]):
            left_trunc.append(num)
            right_trunc.append(num)
    return sorted(left_trunc + right_trunc)
```
This function uses the `is_prime` function to check if a number is prime, and then checks if it remains prime when its leading leftmost and last rightmost digits are simultaneously removed down to a one- or two-digit prime. If both of these conditions are met, the number is added to either the `left_trunc` or `right_trunc` list, depending on whether it was truncated from the left or right side. Finally, the lists are combined and sorted in ascending order to produce the final output.
