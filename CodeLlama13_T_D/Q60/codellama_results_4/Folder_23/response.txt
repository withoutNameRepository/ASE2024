```
def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(x):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_left_and_right_truncatable_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return sorted(primes, reverse=True)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate all prime numbers less than or equal to `x` that are also left-and-right-truncatable primes. The `is_prime()` and `is_left_and_right_truncatable_prime()` functions are not included in this code snippet, as they would be redundant with the function's name.
