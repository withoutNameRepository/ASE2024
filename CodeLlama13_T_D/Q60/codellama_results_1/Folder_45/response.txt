def all_left_right_truncatable_prime(nums):
    x = nums[61]
    left_and_right_truncatable_primes = []
    for i in range(2, x+1):
        if is_prime(i) and is_left_and_right_truncatable_prime(i):

Note: The `is_prime` function is not included in the code snippet, but it should be implemented as a separate function that takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is prime and `False` otherwise. Similarly, the `is_left_and_right_truncatable_prime` function is also not included in the code snippet, but it should be implemented as a separate function that takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is a left-and-right-truncatable prime number and `False` otherwise.
