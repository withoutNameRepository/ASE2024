Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982, 812, 903, 317, 732, 899, 687, 477, 109, 439, 614, 913, 966]

The correct answer was:
[277, 271, 257, 251, 239, 233, 229, 227, 223, 179, 173, 157, 151, 139, 137, 131, 127, 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[317, 313, 311, 293, 283, 281, 277, 271, 269, 263, 257, 251, 241, 239, 233, 229, 227, 223, 211, 199, 197, 193, 191, 181, 179, 173, 167, 163, 157, 151, 149, 139, 137, 131, 127, 113, 97, 89, 83, 79, 73, 71, 67, 61, 59, 53, 47, 43, 41, 37, 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]
