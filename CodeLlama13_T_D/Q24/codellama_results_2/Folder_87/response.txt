```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if n % i == 0 and 50 <= i <= 81:
            divisors.append(i)
    return sum(divisors) or 0
```
This function uses a list comprehension to find all positive divisors of `n` that are between 50 and 81, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, it returns 0.
