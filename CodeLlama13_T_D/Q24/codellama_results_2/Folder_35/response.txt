```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(392, 465+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return sum(divisors) or 0
```
Note that the above code uses a list comprehension to find all the positive divisors of `n` between 392 and 465, both inclusive. It then uses the `sum()` function to add up all the elements in the list, or returns 0 if the list is empty.

Also note that this solution assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer. If it's not, you may need to modify the code to handle that case as well.
