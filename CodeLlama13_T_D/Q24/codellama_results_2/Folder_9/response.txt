```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    return sum(d for d in range(3, 10) if n % d == 0)
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 3 and 9, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to calculate the sum of these divisors. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
