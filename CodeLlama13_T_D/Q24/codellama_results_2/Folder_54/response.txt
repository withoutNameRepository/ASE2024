```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    return sum([d for d in range(36, 94) if n % d == 0]) or 0
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a list of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 36 and 93, both inclusive. It then sums the elements in this list using the `sum()` function, and if no such divisors exist in the specified range, it returns 0.
