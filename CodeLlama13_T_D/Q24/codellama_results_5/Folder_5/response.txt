def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    return sum([d for d in range(7, 9) if n % d == 0]) or 0
```
Note: This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 7 and 8, both inclusive. The `sum()` function is then used to compute the sum of these divisors. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
