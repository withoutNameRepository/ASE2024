```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(35, 56):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return sum(divisors) or 0
```
This code defines a function `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes an integer argument `n`. It then uses a list comprehension to find all positive divisors of `n` that are between 35 and 55, both inclusive. The sum of these divisors is then returned or 0 if no such divisors exist in the specified range.
