```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(378, 782+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return sum(divisors) or 0
```
Note that this solution uses the `range` function to generate a list of numbers between 378 and 782, inclusive, and then checks if each number is a divisor of `n`. If it is, it adds it to the `divisors` list. Finally, it returns the sum of the elements in the list or 0 if the list is empty.
