[Inst] Please explain the code you have provided.
[/Inst]  This is a Python function called `sum_of_divisors_in_range` that takes a positive integer as its argument and returns the sum of all positive divisors of the given integer that are between 4 and 7, both inclusive. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function should return 0.

Here's an explanation of how the code works:

1. The function first defines an empty list called `divisors` to store all positive divisors of `n` that are between 4 and 7, both inclusive.
2. It then iterates over the range of numbers from 4 to 8 using a for loop. For each number `i` in this range, it checks if `n` is divisible by `i`. If it is, it adds `i` to the list `divisors`.
3. After the for loop finishes, the function returns the sum of all elements in the list `divisors`. If the list is empty (meaning no divisors were found), it returns 0 instead.

Overall, this code is a simple implementation of the problem described in the text specification. It checks if any positive divisors of `n` are between 4 and 7, both inclusive, and returns their sum if they exist. If not, it returns 0.
