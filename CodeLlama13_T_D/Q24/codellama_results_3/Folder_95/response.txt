```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and 35 <= i <= 98:
            divisors.append(i)
    return sum(divisors) or 0
```
This function uses a list comprehension to find all positive divisors of the input number that are between 35 and 98, both inclusive. It then returns the sum of these divisors or 0 if no such divisors exist in the specified range.
