```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    return sum([d for d in range(20, 51) if n % d == 0])
```
This function first creates a list of all positive divisors of `n` using a list comprehension. Then it filters this list to include only the elements that are between 20 and 50, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the sum of the filtered list or 0 if the list is empty.
