```
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    return sum([d for d in divisors if 224 <= d <= 584])
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

The function first initializes a list `divisors` to store all positive divisors of `n`. Then, it loops through each integer `i` from 2 to `n+1`, and checks if `n` is divisible by `i` using the modulo operator. If it is divisible, it appends the divisor to the list.

After the loop finishes, the function uses a list comprehension to filter out all divisors that are between 224 and 584, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the sum of these filtered divisors using `sum`. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.

Note: The function assumes that the input argument is a positive integer. If you want to handle negative inputs as well, you can modify the code accordingly.
