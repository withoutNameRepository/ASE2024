```python
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    return sum([d for d in range(41, 56) if n % d == 0])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to generate a list of all positive divisors of `n` that are between 41 and 55, both inclusive. It then takes the sum of this list using the `sum()` function. If no such divisors exist in the specified range, the function returns 0.
