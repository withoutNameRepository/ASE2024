```
def sum_of_divisors_in_range(n):
    if n < 1: return 0
    s = 0
    for i in range(6, 9 + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and i <= n:
            s += i
    return s
```
Note: The above code uses a simple loop to check each number from 6 to 9 (both inclusive) and adds it to the sum `s` if it is a divisor of `n`. The `if` statement checks that the divisor is within the specified range.
