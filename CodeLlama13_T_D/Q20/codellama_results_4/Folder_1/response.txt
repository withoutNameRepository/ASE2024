```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[18:39][10]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 11th smallest number from index 18 to index 38, both inclusive. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and then slicing is used to get the desired indices.
