```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[18:190][18]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 19th smallest number from index 19 to index 190, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list using the `sorted()` function and then slices it to get the desired range of indices. Finally, it returns the 19th element of that slice which is the desired number.
