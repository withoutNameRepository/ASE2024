```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[23:46][7-1]
```
This function first sorts the list of numbers using the `sorted()` function, then it slices the list from index 23 to index 45 (both inclusive) using `[23:46]`. Finally, it returns the 7th smallest number from this slice by indexing into the resulting list with `[7-1]`. Note that since we're working with a sorted list, the 7th smallest number will always be at index `7-1` (i.e., index 6) in the sliced list.
