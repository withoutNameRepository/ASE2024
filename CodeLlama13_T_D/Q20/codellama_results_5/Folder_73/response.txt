```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    return sorted(distinct_numbers)[35:61][3]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 35 to index 60, both inclusive. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and then the slicing `[35:61]` is used to get the subset of elements between indices 35 and 60, inclusive. Finally, the indexing `[3]` returns the 4th smallest number from this subset.

Note that if there are fewer than 61 elements in the list, the slice `[35:61]` will not include all the elements after index 35. In this case, you may need to adjust the slicing accordingly.
