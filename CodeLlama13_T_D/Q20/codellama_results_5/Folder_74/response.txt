def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[17]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 17th smallest number from index 12 to index 90, both inclusive. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and the `[17]` notation is used to access the 17th element of the sorted list.
