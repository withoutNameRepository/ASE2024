```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[9]
```
This is a Python function named `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 10th smallest number from index 0 to index 9, both inclusive. The function first sorts the list using the built-in `sorted()` function, and then uses slicing notation `[9]` to extract the 10th smallest number from the sorted list.

For example, if `my_list = [3, 2, 5, 1, 6, 4]`, the output of this function would be `2`.
