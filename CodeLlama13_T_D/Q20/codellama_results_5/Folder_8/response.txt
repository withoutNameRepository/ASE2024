def find_n_th_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    return sorted(distinct_numbers)[15:32]
```
This is a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 10th smallest number from index 15 to index 31, both inclusive. The function uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the list of numbers in ascending order, and then it returns the slice of the list from index 15 to index 31, both inclusive.
