```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers[2:8])[6]
```
This is a function called `find_n_th_smallest_num` that takes in a list of distinct numbers and returns the 7th smallest number from index 2 to index 8, both inclusive. The function first sorts the input list using the built-in `sorted()` function, then it uses slicing notation `[6]` to get the 7th element from the sorted list.
