```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    return sorted(distinct_numbers)[127:848+1][9]
```
This function first sorts the list of distinct numbers, then it returns the 10th smallest number from index 127 to index 848, both inclusive.
The `+1` is used to make the slice include the 848th element as well.
