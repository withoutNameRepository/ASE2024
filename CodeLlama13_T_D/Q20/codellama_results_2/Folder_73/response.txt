def find_n_th_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    return sorted(distinct_numbers)[35:61][4]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the 4th smallest number from index 35 to index 60, both inclusive. It does this by first sorting the list using `sorted`, then slicing the sorted list from indices 35 to 61 (both inclusive), and finally returning the 4th element of that slice using `[4]`.
