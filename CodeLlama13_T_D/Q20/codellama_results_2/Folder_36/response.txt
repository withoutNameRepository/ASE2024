```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    return sorted(distinct_numbers)[291:313][4]
```
[PYTHON]
This is a function that takes in a list of distinct numbers and returns the 5th smallest number from index 291 to index 312, both inclusive. It first sorts the list using the sorted() built-in function, then slices the list from index 291 to index 312 (both inclusive) using square bracket notation, and finally returns the 4th element of that slice, which is the 5th smallest number in the original list.
