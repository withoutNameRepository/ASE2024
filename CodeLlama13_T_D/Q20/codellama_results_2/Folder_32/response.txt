```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[59:74][3]
```
This function first sorts the list of numbers using `sorted()` and then returns the 4th smallest number from indices 59 to 74, both inclusive. The `[3]` at the end selects the fourth element of the resulting sublist.
