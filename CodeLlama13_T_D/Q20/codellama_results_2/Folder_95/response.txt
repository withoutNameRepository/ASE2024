```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[44:49]
```
This function first sorts the input list using `sorted()` function, then it returns a slice of the list from index 44 to 48 both inclusive.

Note that this solution assumes that the input list contains only distinct numbers. If there are duplicate elements in the list, the behavior of this function is undefined.
