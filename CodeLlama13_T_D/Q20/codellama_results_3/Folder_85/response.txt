```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(distinct_nums):
    return sorted(distinct_nums)[4:8]
```
Note that this function assumes the input list is a list of distinct numbers, and it returns the 5th smallest number from index 2 to index 8, both inclusive. If the input list contains duplicate values, the behavior of the function is undefined.
