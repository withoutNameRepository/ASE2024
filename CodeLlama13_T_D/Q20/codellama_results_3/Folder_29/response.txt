def find_n_th_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    return sorted(distinct_numbers)[19:63][11]
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input, sorts the list, and returns the 12th smallest number from index 20 to index 62, both inclusive. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list in ascending order, and `[19:63]` slices the sorted list to get the desired range of numbers. Then, `[11]` selects the 12th smallest number from that range.
