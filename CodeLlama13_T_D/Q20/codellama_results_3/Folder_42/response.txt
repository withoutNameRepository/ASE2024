```
def find_n_th_smallest_num(mylist):
    return sorted(mylist)[58:83][-1]
```
This function first sorts the list and then uses slicing to select a subset of elements from index 58 to index 82, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the last element of this subset, which is the 6th smallest number in the original list.
