```python
def find_n_th_smallest_num(my_list):
    return sorted(my_list)[26:90][3]
```
This function first sorts the list of numbers using `sorted()`, then it slices the list to get the elements between indices 26 and 90, both inclusive. Finally, it returns the 4th smallest number from that slice by accessing the `[3]` element of the resulting list.
