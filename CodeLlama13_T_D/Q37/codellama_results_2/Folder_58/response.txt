```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if (ord(c) < 503 or ord(c) > 753 or ord(c) < 9 or ord(c) > 122)])
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if its ASCII value is between 503 and 753 (inclusive), and if it is greater than or equal to '9' and less than or equal to 'w'. If so, it adds that character to the output list. Finally, it joins the resulting characters into a single string using the `join()` method.

Note that this code assumes that the input string only contains ASCII characters. If your input string can contain non-ASCII characters, you may need to modify this code accordingly.
