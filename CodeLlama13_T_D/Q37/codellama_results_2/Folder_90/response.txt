```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return "".join([c for c in s if not (348 <= ord(c) <= 852 and 'J' <= c <= 'b')])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `s`, and for each character that meets the specified criteria, it joins all the other characters in the string using `"".join()`. The resulting string is then returned.
