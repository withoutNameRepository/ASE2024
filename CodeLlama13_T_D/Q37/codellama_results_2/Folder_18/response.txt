```
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if 770 <= ord(c) <= 970 and '-' <= c <= 'D'])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `s`, and only includes those that satisfy the specified conditions. The `ord` function is used to convert each character to its ASCII code, which is then compared against the desired range.
