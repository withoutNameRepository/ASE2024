```
def filter_chars(string):
    return ''.join([char for char in string if not (ord('5') <= ord(char) <= ord('_'))])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, and checks whether each character is between indices 2 and 3, both inclusive, and greater than or equal to character '5' and smaller than or equal to character '_'. If it is, then it is not included in the output. The `ord()` function is used to convert characters to their ASCII values, which allows for a simple comparison.
