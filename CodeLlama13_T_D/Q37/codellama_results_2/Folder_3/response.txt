```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 57 and ord(c) > 46])
```
This function uses list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `s` and keep only those that have an ASCII code between 37 and 56, both inclusive. The `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII code of each character, and the `<=` and `>=` operators are used to check if the code is greater than or equal to 6 and smaller than or equal to `_`. Finally, the list comprehension is converted back to a string using `''.join()`.
