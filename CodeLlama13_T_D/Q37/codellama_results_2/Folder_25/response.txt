```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if not (ord(';') <= ord(c) <= ord('g') and 31 <= i <= 38)])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string `s`, and checks each character `c` against the given conditions. If the character is not between indices 31 and 38, or is not greater than or equal to character ';' and smaller than or equal to character 'g', it is included in the output list. Otherwise, it is excluded from the output list. The final string is generated by joining the characters of the output list using `''.join()`.

Note that this solution uses the `ord()` function to convert each character to its ASCII code, which allows for a more efficient comparison of the characters.
