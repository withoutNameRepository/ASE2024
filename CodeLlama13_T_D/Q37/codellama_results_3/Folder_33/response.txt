```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if ord(c) < 722 or ord(c) > 832 or (ord('K') <= ord(c) <= ord('m'))])
```
This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string `s`, and it only keeps those that do not fall between indices 722 and 832, or are not between 'K' and 'm'. The resulting list is then joined into a new string using the `''.join()` method.
