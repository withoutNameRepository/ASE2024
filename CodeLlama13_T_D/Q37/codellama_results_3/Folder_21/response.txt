```
def filter_chars(s):
    return "".join([c for c in s if not (603 <= ord(c) <= 759 and 'Q' <= c <= 'h')])
```
This function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string `s`. For each character, it checks if its ASCII code is between 603 and 759 (inclusive), and if it is greater than or equal to the character `'Q'` and smaller than or equal to the character `'h'`. If both conditions are true, the character is not included in the output string. Otherwise, it is included. The output string is constructed using the join method of the `str` class, which concatenates all characters in the list into a single string.
