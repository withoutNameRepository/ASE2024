```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return "".join([c for c in s if not (155 <= ord(c) <= 403 and '(' <= c <= ']')])
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the characters of `s`, and checks each character against the specified criteria. If a character meets the criteria, it is included in the output string; otherwise, it is excluded. The output string is then joined using `"".join()`.
