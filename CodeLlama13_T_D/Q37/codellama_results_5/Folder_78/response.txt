```
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if not (ord(c) >= 75 and ord(c) <= 99 and ord(c) >= 8 and ord(c) <= 14)]).
```
This code uses list comprehension to iterate over the characters of the input string, `s`, and exclude any characters that satisfy the conditions specified in the text. The `ord` function is used to convert each character to its ASCII value, which allows for comparison with other characters using their ASCII values.
