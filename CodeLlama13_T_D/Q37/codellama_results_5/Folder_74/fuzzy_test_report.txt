(1) With the following counter example:
['dRe +&6=00>796  %>6sq h9  4FrY5Ps0h7 YZS7VhzB 2 %@K8l1DUc388 7$f 5>& 9025  ']

The correct answer was:
dRe +&6=00>796  %>6sq 9  4FrY5Ps07 YZS7VzB 2 %@K8l1DUc388 7$f 5>& 9025  

But the LLM code returned:
dRe +&6=00>796  %>6sq 9  4FrY5Ps07 YZS7VzB 2 %@K81DUc388 7$ 5>& 9025
