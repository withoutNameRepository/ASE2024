```
def filter_chars(string):
    return ''.join([char for char in string if (ord(char) < 138 or ord(char) > 920) and (ord(char) >= 6 and ord(char) <= 70)])
```
This code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character of the input `string`, and checks if it is between indices 138 and 920, both inclusive, and greater than or equal to character '6' and smaller than or equal to character 'A'. If all these conditions are true, the character is removed from the string using the `join` method. The resulting list of characters is then joined back into a string using the `join` method.
