```python
def filter_chars(s):
    return ''.join([c for c in s if (ord(c) < 73 or ord(c) > 74) and (ord(c) < 85 or ord(c) > 122)])
```
This solution uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character of the input string, and only includes characters that are not between indices 73 and 74, both inclusive, and are also greater than or equal to 'U' and smaller than or equal to 'l'. The `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII value of each character, which allows for easier comparison with the desired range of characters.
