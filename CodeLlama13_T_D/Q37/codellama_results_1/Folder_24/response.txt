def filter_chars(string):
    return ''.join([c for c in string if (36 <= ord(c) <= 79 and ord('2') <= ord(c) <= ord('s'))])
```
This code defines a function `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string. It uses list comprehension to create a new string with all characters that meet the specified criteria (occur between indices 36 and 79, both inclusive, be greater than or equal to '2', and smaller than or equal to 's'). The `ord()` function is used to get the ASCII code of each character in the string.
