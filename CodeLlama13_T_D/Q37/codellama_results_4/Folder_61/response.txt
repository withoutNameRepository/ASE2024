```python
def filter_chars(string):
    return ''.join([char for char in string if (ord(char) < ord('G') or ord(char) > ord('p'))])
```
This code creates a function called `filter_chars` that takes one argument, a string. It then uses list comprehension to iterate over each character of the given string and check whether it occurs between indices 5 and 6 (both inclusive) and is greater than or equal to character 'G' and smaller than or equal to character 'p'. If the condition is true, all occurrences of that character are removed from the string. Finally, the altered string is returned.
