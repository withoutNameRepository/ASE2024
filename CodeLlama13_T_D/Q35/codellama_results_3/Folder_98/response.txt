```python
def remove_repeat_chars(s):
    seen = set()
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c not in seen and len(seen) < 7:
            seen.add(c)
            res += c
    return res
```
Explanation:

* The function first initializes an empty set `seen` to keep track of the characters that have already been encountered.
* It then iterates over the input string `s`, and for each character `c`:
	+ If `c` is not in `seen` and the length of `seen` is less than 7, it adds `c` to `seen` and appends it to the result string `res`.
* The function returns the altered string `res`.
