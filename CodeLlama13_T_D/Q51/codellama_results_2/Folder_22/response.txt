def if_contains_anagrams(my_list):

```
This code defines a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function uses a list comprehension to find the number of elements in the list that satisfy the given conditions:

* They have at least three unique characters (i.e., they are not simply repeated letters).
* They have at most 14 anagrams when the characters are rearranged.

The function returns `True` if there is at least one element in the list that satisfies these conditions, and `False` otherwise.
