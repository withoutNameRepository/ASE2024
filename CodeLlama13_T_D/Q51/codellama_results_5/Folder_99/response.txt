```
def if_contains_anagrams(my_list):
    return len([i for i in my_list if ''.join(sorted(i)) in my_list and len(set(i.lower())) >= 3]) <= 93
```
This function first creates a list comprehension that filters the elements of `my_list` to only include those that are anagrams of other strings in the list, and have at least three unique lowercase letters. It then takes the length of this list and returns true if it is less than or equal to 93, otherwise it returns false.
