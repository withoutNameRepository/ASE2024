```
def if_contains_anagrams(my_list):
    return len([i for i in my_list if len(set(j for j in i)) > 3]) <= 94
```
This code defines a function called `if_contains_anagrams` that takes one argument, a list of strings. The function uses a list comprehension to find all the strings in the input list that have at least three unique characters (i.e., anagrams). It then checks if the length of this list is less than or equal to 94. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Note: This code assumes that the strings in the input list are all lowercase English letters (a-z) and do not contain any whitespace or punctuation characters. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
