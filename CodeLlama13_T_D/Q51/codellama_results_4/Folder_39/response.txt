```python
def if_contains_anagrams(my_list):
    return len([i for i in my_list if len(set(i)) == 3 and ''.join(sorted(i)) in my_list]) <= 257
```
This function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of all strings in `my_list` that have anagram pairs. The length of this list is then compared to the maximum allowed value of 257, and the result is returned as a boolean.
