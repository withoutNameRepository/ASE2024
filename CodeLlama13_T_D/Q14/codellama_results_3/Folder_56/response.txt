```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    if len(my_list) < 2:
        return None
    second_smallest = my_list[0]
    for i in range(1, len(my_list)):
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
    return second_smallest
```
Here's a breakdown of the code:

* The function takes one argument `my_list`, which is a list of distinct numbers.
* We check if the length of the list is less than 2, in which case there is no second smallest element and we return None.
* Otherwise, we initialize `second_smallest` to be the first element of the list.
* We loop through each element of the list from index 1 to the end (exclusive), and if an element is found that is smaller than `second_smallest`, we update `second_smallest` with that value.
* After the loop completes, we return `second_smallest`.
