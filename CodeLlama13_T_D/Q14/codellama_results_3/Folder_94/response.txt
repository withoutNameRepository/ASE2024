```python
def find_second_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(52, 72):
        if distinct_numbers[i] < second_smallest or second_smallest is None:
            second_smallest = distinct_numbers[i]
    return second_smallest
```
Note that this function assumes the input list of numbers is already sorted and contains only distinct values. If this is not the case, the function may not work correctly.
