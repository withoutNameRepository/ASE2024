```python
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(33, 37):
        if numbers[i] < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = numbers[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This code defines a function `find_second_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from indices 33 to 36, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, it will return None. The function iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than the current `second_smallest` value. If a smaller value is found, it updates `second_smallest`. Finally, it returns the final value of `second_smallest`.
