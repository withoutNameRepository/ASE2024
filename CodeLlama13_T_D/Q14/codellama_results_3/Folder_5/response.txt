```python
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(3, 6):
        if numbers[i] < numbers[i - 1]:
            second_smallest = numbers[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 3 to index 5, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, it returns None.
