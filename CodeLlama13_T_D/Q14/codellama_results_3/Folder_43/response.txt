```
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(74, 96):
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest or second_smallest is None:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
    return second_smallest
```
Note: This solution assumes that the list contains only distinct numbers. If the list may contain duplicates, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
