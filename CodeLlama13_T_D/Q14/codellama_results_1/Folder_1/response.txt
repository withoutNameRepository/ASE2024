```python
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers[34:56])[1] if len(numbers[34:56]) > 1 else None
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 34 to index 55, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, it returns `None`. It first sorts the sublist of numbers using the built-in `sorted` function, then returns the second element (indexed at 1) of the sorted list if its length is greater than 1. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
