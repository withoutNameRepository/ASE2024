```
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(90, 201):
        if my_list[i] < my_list[i-1]:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
            break
    return second_smallest
```
This function will loop through the list and check if there is an element that is smaller than its previous element. If such an element is found, it will be assigned to `second_smallest` and the function will exit. Otherwise, the function will return `None`.
