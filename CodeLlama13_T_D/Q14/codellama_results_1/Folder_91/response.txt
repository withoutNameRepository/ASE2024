```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return None
    sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
    second_smallest = sorted_list[1]
    for i in range(2,6):
        if my_list[i] == second_smallest:
            return None
    return second_smallest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 0 to index 5, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, it returns `None`. The function first checks if the length of the input list is less than or equal to 1, in which case there are no elements to compare. It then sorts the list and finds the second smallest element using the `sorted()` function and slicing `[1]`. The loop starting from index 2 to index 5 compares each element with the previously found second smallest element and returns `None` if they are equal. Finally, it returns the second smallest element or `None`.
