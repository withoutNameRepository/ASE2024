```python
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(30, 49):
        if numbers[i] < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = numbers[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This function uses a loop to iterate over the list of distinct numbers and checks each element at index 30 to 48 (both inclusive). If an element is found that is smaller than the current second smallest element, it becomes the new second smallest element. The function returns the second smallest element if it finds one, otherwise it returns `None`.

Note: This solution assumes that the list of distinct numbers is passed in as a parameter to the function and that the indices 30 to 48 (both inclusive) are valid indices for the list.
