```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(5, 8):
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest or second_smallest is None:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function returns `None`.

For example, if we call this function with the argument `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, it will return `6` because that is the second smallest element from index 5 to index 7, both inclusive. If we call this function with the argument `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, it will return `None` because there is no such an element in the list.
