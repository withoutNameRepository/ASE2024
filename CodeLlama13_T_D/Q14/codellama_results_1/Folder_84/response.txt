```python
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(40, 81):
        current = numbers[i]
        if second_smallest is None or current < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = current
    return second_smallest
```
Note: This function assumes that the input list `numbers` contains only distinct numbers and that the range of indices from 40 to 80, both inclusive, are valid indices in the list. If these assumptions are not met, the function may not work correctly or may raise an error.
