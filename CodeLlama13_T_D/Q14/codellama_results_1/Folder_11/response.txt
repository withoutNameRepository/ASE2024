    for i in range(66, 94):

This code defines a function `find_second_smallest_num` that takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 66 to index 93, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, it will return `None`.

The function iterates over the given list using a for loop, and checks if each element is smaller than the current second smallest value. If an element is found that is smaller than the current second smallest value, the new value is assigned to `second_smallest` and the next iteration will check against this new value instead of the original one.

The function returns the final value of `second_smallest`, which will be either a number or `None`.
