```
def find_second_smallest_num(distinct_numbers):
    sorted_nums = sorted(distinct_numbers)
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(62, 64):
        if i < len(sorted_nums):
            second_smallest = sorted_nums[i]
    return second_smallest
```
Note: The code assumes that the input list is sorted and contains distinct numbers.
