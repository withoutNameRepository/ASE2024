```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 1:
        return None

    sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
    second_smallest = sorted_list[1]

    for i in range(2, 7):
        if sorted_list[i] != second_smallest:
            return second_smallest

    return None
```
<!---
This is a function called 'find_second_smallest_num' that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input and returns the second smallest element from index 0 to index 6, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'.
