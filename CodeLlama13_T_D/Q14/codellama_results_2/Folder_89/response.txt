```
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return None
    second_smallest = float('inf')
    for i in range(62, 63+1):
        if numbers[i] < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = numbers[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This code uses the `float('inf')` constant to represent an infinite value that can be compared with other values. The function first checks if there are at least two elements in the input list, and returns None otherwise. It then sets the initial value of `second_smallest` to infinity and iterates over the list from index 62 to 63, inclusive, comparing each element with `second_smallest`. If a smaller value is found, it updates `second_smallest` to that value. Finally, the function returns either None if no such element exists or the second smallest element if it does exist.
