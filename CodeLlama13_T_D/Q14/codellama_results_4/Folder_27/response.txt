```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(25, 60):
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 25 to index 59, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, it returns 'None'.
