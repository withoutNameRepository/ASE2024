```python
def find_second_smallest_num(distinct_nums):
    if len(distinct_nums) < 10:
        return None
    else:
        second_smallest = sorted(distinct_nums[8:9])[0]
        return second_smallest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 8 to index 9, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'. The function first checks if the length of the input list is less than 10, if it is then it returns None, otherwise it sorts the list and returns the second smallest element from index 8 to index 9, both inclusive.
