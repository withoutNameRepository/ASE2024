```
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(19, 93):
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This function iterates through the list and checks whether each element is smaller than the current `second_smallest`. If it is, then that element becomes the new `second_smallest`. After the loop is complete, if there was no such element, `second_smallest` will still be set to `None`, which indicates that there is no second smallest number.

Note that this function assumes that the input list contains only distinct numbers. If the list contains duplicates, the behavior of the function may not be as expected.
