```python
def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    sorted_nums = sorted(numbers)
    if len(sorted_nums) <= 95:
        return None
    else:
        return sorted_nums[74 + 1]
```
This code defines a function called `find_second_smallest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, as input. The function returns the second smallest element from index 74 to index 95, both inclusive, if there is such an element in the list. If there is no such element, the function returns `None`.

The code first sorts the input list using the `sorted()` built-in function and then checks if the length of the sorted list is greater than or equal to 95. If not, the function returns `None` as there are not enough elements in the list to return a second smallest element. Otherwise, the function returns the second smallest element from index 74 to index 95, both inclusive, which is computed by adding 1 to the index of the second smallest element in the sorted list (i.e., `sorted_nums[74 + 1]`).
