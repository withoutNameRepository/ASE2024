Here is a text specification delimited by angle brackets. Create Python code according to the text specification.
<Write a function called 'remove_duplicates' that takes one argument, a list of strings, as input and returns a new list with all duplicates removed.> The Python code should be delimited only by triple backticks. Do not add comments to your code. Generate only one solution.
```
def remove_duplicates(my_list):
    return list(dict.fromkeys(my_list))
