```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(22, 51):
        if my_list[i] < my_list[i-1]:
            second_smallest = my_list[i-1]
    return second_smallest
```
Note: This solution assumes that the input list is a list of distinct numbers and that the function should only consider elements from indices 22 to 50 (both inclusive).
