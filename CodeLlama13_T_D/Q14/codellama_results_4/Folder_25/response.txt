def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(37, 76+1):
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest or second_smallest is None:
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This function iterates over the given list and checks each element to see if it is the second smallest. If an element is found that is smaller than the current second smallest, then it becomes the new second smallest. The function returns `None` if no such element exists.
