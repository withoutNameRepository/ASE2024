def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    if len(my_list) < 2:
        return None
    second_smallest = float('inf')
    for i in range(43, 52):
        if my_list[i] < second_smallest and my_list[i] != float('inf'):
            second_smallest = my_list[i]
    return second_smallest
```
This function first checks if the input list has at least two elements. If not, it returns None. Then it initializes a variable `second_smallest` to infinity and loops over indices 43 to 51 of the input list. For each index, it checks if the corresponding element is less than `second_smallest` and different from infinity (i.e., it hasn't been assigned before). If both conditions are met, then `second_smallest` is updated with the current element value. Finally, the function returns `second_smallest`.
