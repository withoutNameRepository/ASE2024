```python
def find_second_smallest_num(my_list):
    if len(my_list) <= 88:
        return None
    sorted_list = sorted(my_list[75:89])
    second_smallest = sorted_list[1]
    return second_smallest
```
This function takes a list of distinct numbers as input and returns the second smallest element from index 75 to index 88, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, it returns None. The function first checks if the length of the input list is greater than or equal to 89 by using the `len()` function. It then uses the `sorted()` function to sort the list from index 75 to index 88, both inclusive, and returns the second smallest element in the sorted list using indexing.
