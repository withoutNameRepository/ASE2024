def find_second_smallest_num(numbers):
    # Find the second smallest number in the list
    second_smallest = None
    for i in range(19, 93):

This code defines a function called `find_second_smallest_num` that takes one argument, a list of distinct numbers, and returns the second smallest element from index 19 to index 92, both inclusive. If there is no such an element, the function should return 'None'. The function uses a for loop to iterate over the list and compare each number with the current value of `second_smallest`. If a smaller number is found, it updates `second_smallest` with that value. Finally, the function returns `second_smallest`, which will be the second smallest element in the given range or 'None' if there is no such an element.
