```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set([p for n in numbers[94] for p in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1) if n % p == 0])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 94. The `set` constructor is used to create a set from the list of prime factors, which ensures that each factor is only included once in the result.
