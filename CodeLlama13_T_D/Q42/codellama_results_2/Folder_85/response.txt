```
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(prime_factorization(numbers[23]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 23. It does this by calling the `prime_factorization` function, which takes an integer as input and returns its prime factorization as a set. The resulting set is then returned from the function.
