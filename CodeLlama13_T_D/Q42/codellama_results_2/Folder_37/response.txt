```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return {p for n in numbers[28] for p in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1) if n % p == 0}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find all prime factors of the integer at index 28 in the list of positive integers `numbers`. The comprehension starts by iterating over each number in the list, and then it iterates over each prime number up to the square root of that number. If a number is divisible by one of these primes, the function adds it to the set of prime factors.

The function returns the resulting set of all prime factors.
