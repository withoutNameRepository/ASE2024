def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(filter(lambda x: x > 1, (factor for n in numbers if n == 926 for factor in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1) if n % factor == 0)))
```
This code defines a function called `prime_factors` that takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 926 in the list. The function uses a generator expression to find all prime factors, which is then converted into a set using the built-in `set()` constructor.
