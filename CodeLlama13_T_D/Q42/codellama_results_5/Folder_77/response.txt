def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(prime_factorization(numbers[985]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 985. It does this by using the `prime_factorization` function to factorize the number at index 985, and then returning the resulting set of prime factors.
