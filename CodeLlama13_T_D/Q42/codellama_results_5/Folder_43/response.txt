def prime_factors(list_of_integers):
    return set([i for i in range(2, 31) if all(j % i == 0 for j in list_of_integers)])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of prime factors of the integer at index 29. The `all` function is used to check whether all elements in the list are divisible by `i`, and the `set` constructor is used to return the unique prime factors.
