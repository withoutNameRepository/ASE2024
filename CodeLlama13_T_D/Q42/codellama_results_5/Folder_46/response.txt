This function uses a list comprehension to generate the set of prime factors of the integer at index 453 in the input list `lst`. The comprehension iterates over all integers `n` from 1 to the length of the list, and for each integer `n`, it iterates over all prime numbers `p` from 2 to the square root of `n`. If the integer at index `n` is divisible by `p` and none of its other prime factors are divisible by `p`, then `p` is added to the set of prime factors. The resulting set of prime factors is returned.
