```python
def prime_factors(my_list):
    return set((lambda x: set([i for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1) if x % i == 0]))(my_list[0]))
```
This is a function that takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 0. The function uses an anonymous lambda function to find the prime factors, which are then returned as a set.
