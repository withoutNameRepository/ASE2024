```
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(prime_factorize(numbers[56]))
```
The `prime_factorize` function is a built-in Python function that returns the list of all prime factors of an integer. The solution sets the result to a set and returns it, which makes sure there are no duplicates in the output.
