```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    return set(prime_factorizer(my_list[73]))
```
Explanation:
* `prime_factorizer` is a function that takes an integer as input and returns its prime factors in a list.
* The `set()` function creates a set from the list of prime factors.
* The solution uses list indexing to access the 73rd element of the input list, which is assumed to be the integer at index 73.
