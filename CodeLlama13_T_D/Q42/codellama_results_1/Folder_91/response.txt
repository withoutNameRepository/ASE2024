def prime_factors(numbers):
    return {factor for factor in get_prime_factors(numbers[6])}
```
This function uses a set comprehension to find the prime factors of the number at index 6 in the list. The `get_prime_factors` function is not defined here, but it should take an integer as input and return a generator containing all its prime factors.
