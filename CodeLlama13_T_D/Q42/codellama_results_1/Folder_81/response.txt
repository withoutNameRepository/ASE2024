def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(prime_factorize(numbers[20]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 20 using the `prime_factorize` function. The `set` method is used to eliminate duplicates from the returned list.
