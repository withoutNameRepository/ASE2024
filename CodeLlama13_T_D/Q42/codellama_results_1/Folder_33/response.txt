```
def prime_factors(list):
    return set(prime_factorization(list[321]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as an argument and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 321 in the list. It uses the `prime_factorization` function to calculate the prime factorization of the integer, which is then converted to a set using the `set` constructor.

Here is an example usage of this function:
```
>>> prime_factors([321, 654, 987])
{3, 31, 107}
```
