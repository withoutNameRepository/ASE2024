```
def prime_factors(mylist):
    return set(prime_factorize(mylist[47]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 47. The `prime_factorize` function is not defined in this code, so it should be defined separately.

The output will be a set of prime numbers that are factors of the given number.
