```
This code defines a function `prime_factors` that takes a single argument, a list of positive integers. The function returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 80 in the list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of the list and collects all prime factors using the `get_primes` function.

The `get_primes` function is not defined in this code, but it is assumed to be a function that takes a positive integer as input and returns a set of its prime factors.
