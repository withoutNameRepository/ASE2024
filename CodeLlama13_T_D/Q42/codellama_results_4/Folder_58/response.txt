```python
def prime_factors(lst):
    return set([x for x in range(2, lst[714]) if lst[714] % x == 0 and all(y % x != 0 for y in range(2, int(lst[714] ** 0.5) + 1))])
```
This code defines a function `prime_factors` that takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of prime factors of the integer at index 714. The function uses a set comprehension to generate all prime factors, which are defined as numbers between 2 and the square root of the number at index 714 (inclusive) that divide the number at index 714 and do not have any other divisors between 2 and the square root of the number at index 714.
