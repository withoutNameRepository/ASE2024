```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(reduce(list.__add__, (set(range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)) - set(range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1).union(*[set(range(i * j, n, i)) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)]) for j in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))) for n in numbers), []))
```
This code uses the `reduce` function to calculate the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 851 by combining the sets of prime factors generated from each number in the input list using the `set` constructor and the `-` operator. The `math.sqrt` function is used to find the square root of each number, and the `range` function is used to generate ranges of numbers starting from 2 and ending at the square root of each number. The `list.__add__` method is used to combine the lists generated by the `set` constructor, and the `union` method is used to unite the sets generated for each combination of numbers. Finally, the resulting list is converted to a set using the `set` constructor.
