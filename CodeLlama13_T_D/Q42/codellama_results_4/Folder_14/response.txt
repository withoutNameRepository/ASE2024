```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(prime_factorization(numbers[17]))
```
This function uses the `prime_factorization` function, which is defined as follows:
```python
def prime_factorization(n):
    factors = []
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return sorted(factors)
```
This function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of its prime factors in ascending order. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing `n` by the smallest odd number that divides it, and adding the result to the list of factors until `n` is 1 or has no more prime factors.

Note that this function only works for positive integers, since negative numbers cannot be prime factors. Also, if `n` is not a prime factor of `numbers[17]`, then the function will return an empty set.
