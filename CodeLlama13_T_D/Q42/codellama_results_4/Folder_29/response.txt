```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return {i for i in range(2, numbers[19]+1) if numbers[19] % i == 0}
```
<code>{i for i in range(2, numbers[19]+1) if numbers[19] % i == 0}</code> is a set comprehension that generates all prime factors of the integer at index 19. The <code>range</code> function generates an inclusive range of integers from 2 to the square root of the number at index 19, and the <code>if</code> condition checks if the number is divisible by each prime factor.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list contains only positive integers.
