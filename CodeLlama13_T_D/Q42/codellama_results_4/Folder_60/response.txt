def prime_factors(list_of_ints):
    return set(prime_factorization(list_of_ints[88]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 88. It does this by first retrieving the integer at index 88 from the input list, and then using the `prime_factorization` function to find its prime factors. The resulting set of prime factors is then returned.
