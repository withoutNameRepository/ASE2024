```
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(prime_factorization(numbers[537]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 537 in the list.

Here is an example usage of the function:
```
>>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> prime_factors(numbers)
{2, 3, 5}
```
This function uses the `prime_factorization` function to calculate the prime factors of the integer at index 537 in the list. The resulting set of prime factors is returned as the output of the function.
