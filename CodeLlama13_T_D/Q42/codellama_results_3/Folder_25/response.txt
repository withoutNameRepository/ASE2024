```
def prime_factors(my_list):
    return set(reduce(mul, ([p**k for p in prime_factors(n)] for n in my_list), 1))
```
This code uses the `prime_factors` function to find all prime factors of each integer in the list, and then multiplies them together using a generator expression and the `reduce` function from the `functools` module. The resulting set of prime factors is returned.
