```
def prime_factors(list):
    if len(list) <= 87:
        return []
    else:
        return {i for i in range(2, int(sqrt(list[87])) + 1) if list[87] % i == 0}
```
Note that this code assumes that the input list is non-empty and contains only positive integers. It also uses the fact that a prime factor must be less than or equal to the square root of the number being factored, which is why we use `int(sqrt(list[87]))` as the upper bound for the loop.
