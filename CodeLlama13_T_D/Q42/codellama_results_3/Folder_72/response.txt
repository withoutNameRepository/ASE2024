```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set([factor for number in numbers if isprime(number) for factor in factors(number)])
```
This function uses list comprehension to generate a set of all prime factors of the integer at index 16. The `isprime` function is used to check if a number is prime, and the `factors` function is used to get all factors of a number.
