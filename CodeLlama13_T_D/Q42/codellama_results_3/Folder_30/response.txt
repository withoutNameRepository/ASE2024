```python
def prime_factors(numbers):
    return set(prime_factor(numbers[94]))
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input, and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 94 in the list.

It uses the `prime_factor()` function to calculate the prime factors of the given integer, and then converts the resulting list to a set using the `set()` constructor.
