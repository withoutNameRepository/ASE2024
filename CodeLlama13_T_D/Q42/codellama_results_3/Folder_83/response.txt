```
def prime_factors(integers):
    return {factor for factor in range(2, integers[95]) if integers[95] % factor == 0 and is_prime(factor)}
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 95. The `range()` function is used to generate numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number, and then the `is_prime()` function is used to check if each number is prime or not.

Here is an example usage:
```
integers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(prime_factors(integers))  # Output: {5}
```
This code will return the set `{5}` because `5` is the only prime factor of `50`.
