```python
def prime_factors(my_list):
    return set([i for i in range(3, my_list[2], 1) if my_list[2] % i == 0])
```
This function takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the set of all prime factors of the integer at index 2. It uses a list comprehension to generate the prime factors, which are defined as numbers between 3 and the square root of the number at index 2 that divide it evenly.
