```python
def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    chars = sorted([chr(i) for i in range(256)], key=lambda x: ord(x))
    return ''.join(chars[:85])
```
This code defines a function `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes one argument, a string of distinct characters. It creates a list of exactly 85 characters of the given string that have the smallest ASCII values by sorting a list of all possible ASCII characters in descending order and joining them into a string.
