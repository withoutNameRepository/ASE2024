```
def return_n_smallest_chars(distinct_characters):
    sorted_list = sorted([*distinct_characters], key=ord)
    return sorted_list[:29]
```
This function first creates a list of the distinct characters in the input string using the `*` operator to unpack the argument into a list. It then sorts this list based on the ASCII values of each character, which can be accessed using the `ord` function. Finally, it returns the first 29 elements of the sorted list, which are the smallest ASCII-value characters in the input string.
