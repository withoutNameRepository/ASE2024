```python
def return_n_smallest_chars(string):
    return sorted([char for char in string], key=lambda x: ord(x), reverse=True)[:90]
```
This function takes a string of distinct characters as an input, and returns a list containing exactly 90 characters from the given string that have the smallest ASCII values. The `sorted` function is used to sort the list in descending order based on the ASCII value of each character using the `ord` function. Finally, the first 90 elements of the sorted list are returned as output.
Note that this solution assumes that the input string only contains distinct characters. If the input string can contain duplicate characters, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
