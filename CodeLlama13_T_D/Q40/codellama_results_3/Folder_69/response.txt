```python
def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    sorted_chars = sorted(list(set(s)), key=ord)[:65]
    return sorted_chars[::-1]
```
This code defines a function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes a string of distinct characters as an argument. It first creates a list of the unique characters in the input string using the `list` and `set` functions, and then sorts the list using the `ord` function to sort by ASCII value. The `[::-1]` at the end of the `sorted_chars` line reverses the order of the list so that it is sorted in descending order instead of ascending order. Finally, the code returns the first 65 elements of the reversed list as a new list.
