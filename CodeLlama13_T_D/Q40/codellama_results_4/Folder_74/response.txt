def return_n_smallest_chars(string):
    chars = sorted(set(string))
    return chars[:5]
```
This function takes a string as input and returns a list of exactly 5 characters with the smallest ASCII values from the given string. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the set of distinct characters in ascending order, and the slice notation `[:5]` is used to extract the first 5 characters from the sorted list.
