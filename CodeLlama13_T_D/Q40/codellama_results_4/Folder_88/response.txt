```python
def return_n_smallest_chars(string):
    chars = sorted(list(set(string)), key=ord)
    return chars[:84]
```
Note: The `sorted` function takes a list and an optional argument `key`, which is a function that defines the order of the elements in the list. In this case, we are using `ord`, which returns the ASCII value of each character in the string. By passing `ord` as the `key` argument to `sorted`, we are sorting the characters in the string by their ASCII values.
