```python
def return_n_smallest_chars(s):
    sorted_list = sorted(s, key=ord)[:84]
    return sorted_list
```
[PYTHON]
This code creates a function called `return_n_smallest_chars` that takes one argument `s`, which is a string of distinct characters. The function first sorts the list in ascending order using the `ord` function to get the ASCII value of each character and then returns the first 84 elements of the sorted list as a new list.
