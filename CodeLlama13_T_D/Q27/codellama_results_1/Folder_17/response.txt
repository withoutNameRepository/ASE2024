```python
def insert_after_index(my_list):
    index = my_list.index(94) + 1
    return my_list[:index] + [93] + my_list[index:]
```
This function takes a list as an argument and returns a new list that is identical to the given list except for the insertion of 93 at the index immediately succeeding the first occurrence of 94. The returned list should have one more element than the original list.
