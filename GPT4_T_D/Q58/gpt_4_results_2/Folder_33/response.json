Then it uses four nested loops to generate all possible submatrices of the given matrix. For each submatrix, it compares its size with the desired size, 118. If an equality is met, the count of such submatrices is updated. Finally, the function returns this count. Please note that this solution may not be very efficient for large matrices due to its O(n^4) time complexity.",
