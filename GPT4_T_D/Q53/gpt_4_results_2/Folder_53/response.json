Then it looks for all possible substrings of the length greater than or equal to 64 and checks if they are palindromes by comparing them with their reverse. If they are same, that substring is a palindrome and added to the set 'palindromes'. Finally the set is returned which contains all the palindromes of length at least 64.\nIf no such palindromes exist, set will be empty and empty set is returned.",
