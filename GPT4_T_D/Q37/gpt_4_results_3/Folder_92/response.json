Inside the function, we first create a list of characters that occur between indices 4 and 4 which meet the condition specified in the task: to be greater than or equal to character '7' and to be lesser than or equal to character 'o'. After that, we replace all occurrence of characters from the filtered list with empty characters. As a result, we get a string without the characters that should be removed. Finally, we return our modified string.",
