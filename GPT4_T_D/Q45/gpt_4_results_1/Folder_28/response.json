Next, we get all the English letters from the substring and ignore the rest. Then we get all the permutations of the English letters, join them to form words, and check for palindromes that have a length of at least 4. We finally return the set of these palindromes. If no such palindromes exist, this set will be empty. This function is case-insensitive.",
