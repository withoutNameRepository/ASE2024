Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27]

The correct answer was:
3A

But the LLM code returned:
3a

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28, 31)
