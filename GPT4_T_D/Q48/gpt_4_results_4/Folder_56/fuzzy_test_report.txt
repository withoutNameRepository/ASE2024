Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21]

The correct answer was:
1C

But the LLM code returned:
1c

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 28)
