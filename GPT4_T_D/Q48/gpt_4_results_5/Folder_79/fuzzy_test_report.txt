Out of 4 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 3 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, 19, 21, 23]

The correct answer was:
1C

But the LLM code returned:
1c

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
(0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 26)

(3) Test input:
(0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25)
