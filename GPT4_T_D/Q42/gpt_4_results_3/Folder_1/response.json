Whenever a division succeeds, it keeps the factor in a set and divides the number. It repeats this process until the remaining part of the number is less than the square root of the current factor. At the end it adds the remaining part of number to the factor set if it is more than 1. Therefore, this function returns the set of all prime factors of the number at index 85.\nPlease note that this function won't perform correctly if list length is less than 86.",
