The prime factors are stored in a set to eliminate duplications. If, at the end of the while loop, `num` (which has been divided by all its smaller factors) is still larger than 1, it is itself a prime number and is added to the set of factors. This function will return an empty set if the number at index 6 is 1 or 0.",
