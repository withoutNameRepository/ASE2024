Out of 2 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 1 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
['z9&90PR+ 7e0 2 a0w3942+n&H x5Nxb']

The correct answer was:
z9&90PR+ 7e0 2 a0w3942+n&H x5Nxb

But the LLM code returned:
z&0PR+ 7e0 2 a0w342+n&H x5Nxb

The test input with which the LLM code passed were as follows:

(2) Test input:
175 lY*cR z   1U7Y09s1< V6
