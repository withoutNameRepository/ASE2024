Then, it will check the sum of each submatrix. If the sum equals -27, that submatrix will be added to the result list. Finally, it returns the list of all submatrices satisfying the condition.\n\nNOTE: This code will only work properly for matrices with a particular size. Performance can be low for large matrices due to the time complexity of the function. Additionally, the size of the submatrix is determined by the range of the variables 'x2' and 'y2'. It is computed inclusively, that's why we use 'x2+1' and 'y2+1' indices.",
