Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[6, 21, 238, 7, 6, 14, 1, 51, 357, 51, 2, 14, 102, 21, 3, 17, 7, 42, 17, 3, 102, 357, 42, 119, 714, 1, 34, 2, 238, 119, 714, 34]

The correct answer was:
[[14, 1, 51], [42, 17], [714], [714, 1], [714]]

But the LLM code returned:
[[42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17], [42, 17]]
