For each starting position in the list it iterates from this position to the end of the list. A sublist is then built from this starting position to the current end position. The sublist is then iterated over, multiplying all values together. If the product equals `-1` this sublist is appended to the list of results. If the current end position is actually the last item in the list and the current starting position is not the beginning of the list, it builds a sublist starting from the last item in the list and going to the current starting position, effectively wrapping around the list. The product for this sublist is calculated and if this product equals `-1` the sublist is added to the result list. After all possible sublists have been considered, the resulting list is returned.",
