The first check ensures the number is prime. The function `is_prime(n)` accomplishes this by performing trial division, a simple but effective method for checking primality. It works by testing whether `n` is a multiple of any integer between 2 and `sqrt(n)`. If `n` is divisible by any of these, it\u2019s not prime.\n\nThe second check ensures the number remains prime when the digit is removed from the right. The function `is_right_truncatable(n)` does this by recursively truncating the last digit and checking if the resulting number is prime until n is 0, which means we have truncated all digits and all the numbers we got by truncating were primes.\n\nFinally, the list comprehension combines these two checks to generate a list of right-truncatable primes less than x.\n",
