Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982, 812, 903, 317]

The correct answer was:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 23, 29, 31, 37, 53, 59, 71, 73, 79, 233, 239, 293, 311, 313, 317, 373, 379]

But the LLM code returned:
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 53, 59, 71, 73, 79, 113, 131, 137, 139, 173, 179, 191, 193, 197, 199, 233, 239, 293, 311, 313, 317, 373, 379]
