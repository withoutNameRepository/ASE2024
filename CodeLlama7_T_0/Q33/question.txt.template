Write a function called 'return_vowels' that takes one argument, a string. From the given string the function should return the list of all vowel English letters between index $0 (inclusive) and index $1 (exclusive) that are greater than character $2 and smaller than or equal to character $3. If no such characters exist in the specified range, the function should return an empty list.
