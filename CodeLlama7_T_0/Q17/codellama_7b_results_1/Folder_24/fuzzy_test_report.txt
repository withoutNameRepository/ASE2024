Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[333, -549, -112, 283, -26, -275, -264, -31, 476, 448, 5, -58, 12, 74, 121, 454, 531, 335, 341, -282, 401, 202, -105, -8, -73, -266, -193, 91, -288, 8, -88, 53, 281, -240, 404, 450, 252, -440, 407, 312, 513, -462, 357, 514, 184, 130, -535, 438, -198, -26, -340, 442, 241, -209, -217]

The correct answer was:
[-340]

But the LLM code returned:
[]
