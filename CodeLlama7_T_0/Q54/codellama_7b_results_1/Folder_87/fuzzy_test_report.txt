Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289, 758, 622, 258, 910, 982, 812, 903, 317, 732, 899, 687, 477, 109, 439, 614, 913, 966, 482, 866, 267, 806, 553, 23, 722, 404, 826, 671, 11, 498, 868, 251, 331, 871, 199, 571, 246]

The correct answer was:
[599, 593, 379, 373, 317, 313, 311, 293, 239, 233, 79, 73, 71, 59, 53, 37, 31, 29, 23, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[577, 571, 557, 523, 521, 503, 373, 353, 337, 331, 317, 313, 311, 307, 277, 271, 257, 251, 233, 227, 223, 211, 173, 157, 151, 137, 131, 127, 113, 107, 103, 101, 73, 71, 53, 37, 31, 23, 17, 13, 11, 7, 5, 3, 2]
