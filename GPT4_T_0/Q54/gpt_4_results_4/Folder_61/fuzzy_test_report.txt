Out of 1 random test input(s), the code returned by LLM passed 0 times and failed 1 times.

The counter examples were as follows:

(1) With the following counter example:
[845, 760, 426, 266, 516, 410, 785, 310, 481, 587, 909, 509, 289]

The correct answer was:
[239, 233, 79, 73, 71, 59, 53, 37, 31, 29, 23, 7, 5, 3, 2]

But the LLM code returned:
[223, 197, 173, 167, 137, 113, 107, 103, 97, 83, 73, 67, 53, 47, 43, 37, 23, 17, 13, 7, 5, 3, 2]
