Write a function called 'filter_chars' that takes one argument, a string. For each character of the given string that occurs between indices $2 and $3, both inclusive, and is greater than or equal to character '$0' and smaller than or equal to character '$1', the function should remove all occurrences of that character from the string, while preserving the order of all characters in the string. The function should return the altered string.
